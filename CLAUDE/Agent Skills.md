# Agent Skills

Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Each Skill packages instructions, metadata, and optional resources (scripts, templates) that Claude uses automatically when relevant.

---

## Why use Skills

Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that provide Claude with domain-specific expertise: workflows, context, and best practices that transform general-purpose agents into specialists. Unlike prompts (conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), Skills load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across multiple conversations.

**Key benefits**:
- **Specialize Claude**: Tailor capabilities for domain-specific tasks
- **Reduce repetition**: Create once, use automatically
- **Compose capabilities**: Combine Skills to build complex workflows

<Note>
For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

## Using Skills

Anthropic provides pre-built Agent Skills for common document tasks (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF), and you can create your own custom Skills. Both work the same way. Claude automatically uses them when relevant to your request.

**Pre-built Agent Skills** are available to all users on claude.ai and via the Claude API. See the [Available Skills](#available-skills) section below for the complete list.

**Custom Skills** let you package domain expertise and organizational knowledge. They're available across Claude's products: create them in Claude Code, upload them via the API, or add them in claude.ai settings.

<Note>
**Get started:**
- For pre-built Agent Skills: See the [quickstart tutorial](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart) to start using PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PDF skills in the API
- For custom Skills: See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction) to learn how to create your own Skills
</Note>

## How Skills work

Skills leverage Claude's VM environment to provide capabilities beyond what's possible with prompts alone. Claude operates in a virtual machine with filesystem access, allowing Skills to exist as directories containing instructions, executable code, and reference materials, organized like an onboarding guide you'd create for a new team member.

This filesystem-based architecture enables **progressive disclosure**: Claude loads information in stages as needed, rather than consuming context upfront.

### Three types of Skill content, three levels of loading

Skills can contain three types of content, each loaded at different times:

### Level 1: Metadata (always loaded)

**Content type: Instructions**. The Skill's YAML frontmatter provides discovery information:

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---
```

Claude loads this metadata at startup and includes it in the system prompt. This lightweight approach means you can install many Skills without context penalty; Claude only knows each Skill exists and when to use it.

### Level 2: Instructions (loaded when triggered)

**Content type: Instructions**. The main body of SKILL.md contains procedural knowledge: workflows, best practices, and guidance:

````markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Use pdfplumber to extract text from PDFs:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

For advanced form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
````

When you request something that matches a Skill's description, Claude reads SKILL.md from the filesystem via bash. Only then does this content enter the context window.

### Level 3: Resources and code (loaded as needed)

**Content types: Instructions, code, and resources**. Skills can bundle additional materials:

```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md (main instructions)
├── FORMS.md (form-filling guide)
├── REFERENCE.md (detailed API reference)
└── scripts/
    └── fill_form.py (utility script)
```

**Instructions**: Additional markdown files (FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md) containing specialized guidance and workflows

**Code**: Executable scripts (fill_form.py, validate.py) that Claude runs via bash; scripts provide deterministic operations without consuming context

**Resources**: Reference materials like database schemas, API documentation, templates, or examples

Claude accesses these files only when referenced. The filesystem model means each content type has different strengths: instructions for flexible guidance, code for reliability, resources for factual lookup.

| Level | When Loaded | Token Cost | Content |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Level 1: Metadata** | Always (at startup) | ~100 tokens per Skill | `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter |
| **Level 2: Instructions** | When Skill is triggered | Under 5k tokens | SKILL.md body with instructions and guidance |
| **Level 3+: Resources** | As needed | Effectively unlimited | Bundled files executed via bash without loading contents into context |

Progressive disclosure ensures only relevant content occupies the context window at any given time.

### The Skills architecture

Skills run in a code execution environment where Claude has filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. Think of it like this: Skills exist as directories on a virtual machine, and Claude interacts with them using the same bash commands you'd use to navigate files on your computer.

![Agent Skills Architecture - showing how Skills integrate with the agent's configuration and virtual machine](/docs/images/agent-skills-architecture.png)

**How Claude accesses Skill content:**

When a Skill is triggered, Claude uses bash to read SKILL.md from the filesystem, bringing its instructions into the context window. If those instructions reference other files (like FORMS.md or a database schema), Claude reads those files too using additional bash commands. When instructions mention executable scripts, Claude runs them via bash and receives only the output (the script code itself never enters context).

**What this architecture enables:**

**On-demand file access**: Claude reads only the files needed for each specific task. A Skill can include dozens of reference files, but if your task only needs the sales schema, Claude loads just that one file. The rest remain on the filesystem consuming zero tokens.

**Efficient script execution**: When Claude runs `validate_form.py`, the script's code never loads into the context window. Only the script's output (like "Validation passed" or specific error messages) consumes tokens. This makes scripts far more efficient than having Claude generate equivalent code on the fly.

**No practical limit on bundled content**: Because files don't consume context until accessed, Skills can include comprehensive API documentation, large datasets, extensive examples, or any reference materials you need. There's no context penalty for bundled content that isn't used.

This filesystem-based model is what makes progressive disclosure work. Claude navigates your Skill like you'd reference specific sections of an onboarding guide, accessing exactly what each task requires.

### Example: Loading a PDF processing skill

Here's how Claude loads and uses a PDF processing skill:

1. **Startup**: System prompt includes: `PDF Processing - Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents`
2. **User request**: "Extract the text from this PDF and summarize it"
3. **Claude invokes**: `bash: read pdf-skill/SKILL.md` → Instructions loaded into context
4. **Claude determines**: Form filling is not needed, so FORMS.md is not read
5. **Claude executes**: Uses instructions from SKILL.md to complete the task

![Skills loading into context window - showing the progressive loading of skill metadata and content](/docs/images/agent-skills-context-window.png)

The diagram shows:
1. Default state with system prompt and skill metadata pre-loaded
2. Claude triggers the skill by reading SKILL.md via bash
3. Claude optionally reads additional bundled files like FORMS.md as needed
4. Claude proceeds with the task

This dynamic loading ensures only relevant skill content occupies the context window.

## Where Skills work

Skills are available across Claude's agent products:

### Claude API

The Claude API supports both pre-built Agent Skills and custom Skills. Both work identically: specify the relevant `skill_id` in the `container` parameter along with the code execution tool.

**Prerequisites**: Using Skills via the API requires three beta headers:
- `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Skills run in the code execution container
- `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills functionality
- `files-api-2025-04-14` - Required for uploading/downloading files to/from the container

Use pre-built Agent Skills by referencing their `skill_id` (e.g., `pptx`, `xlsx`), or create and upload your own via the Skills API (`/v1/skills` endpoints). Custom Skills are shared organization-wide.

To learn more, see [Use Skills with the Claude API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide).

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) supports only Custom Skills.

**Custom Skills**: Create Skills as directories with SKILL.md files. Claude discovers and uses them automatically.

Custom Skills in Claude Code are filesystem-based and don't require API uploads.

To learn more, see [Use Skills in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

### Claude Agent SDK

The [Claude Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) supports custom Skills through filesystem-based configuration.

**Custom Skills**: Create Skills as directories with SKILL.md files in `.claude/skills/`. Enable Skills by including `"Skill"` in your `allowed_tools` configuration.

Skills in the Agent SDK are then automatically discovered when the SDK runs.

To learn more, see [Agent Skills in the SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills).

### Claude.ai

[Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) supports both pre-built Agent Skills and custom Skills.

**Pre-built Agent Skills**: These Skills are already working behind the scenes when you create documents. Claude uses them without requiring any setup.

**Custom Skills**: Upload your own Skills as zip files through Settings > Features. Available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans with code execution enabled. Custom Skills are individual to each user; they are not shared organization-wide and cannot be centrally managed by admins.

To learn more about using Skills in Claude.ai, see the following resources in the Claude Help Center:
- [What are Skills?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills)
- [Using Skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude)
- [How to create custom Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills)
- [Teach Claude your way of working using Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12580051-teach-claude-your-way-of-working-using-skills)

## Skill structure

Every Skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
[Clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude to follow]

## Examples
[Concrete examples of using this Skill]
```

**Required fields**: `name` and `description`

**Field requirements**:

`name`:
- Maximum 64 characters
- Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Cannot contain XML tags
- Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"

`description`:
- Must be non-empty
- Maximum 1024 characters
- Cannot contain XML tags

The `description` should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it. For complete authoring guidance, see the [best practices guide](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

## Security considerations

We strongly recommend using Skills only from trusted sources: those you created yourself or obtained from Anthropic. Skills provide Claude with new capabilities through instructions and code, and while this makes them powerful, it also means a malicious Skill can direct Claude to invoke tools or execute code in ways that don't match the Skill's stated purpose.

<Warning>
If you must use a Skill from an untrusted or unknown source, exercise extreme caution and thoroughly audit it before use. Depending on what access Claude has when executing the Skill, malicious Skills could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or other security risks.
</Warning>

**Key security considerations**:
- **Audit thoroughly**: Review all files bundled in the Skill: SKILL.md, scripts, images, and other resources. Look for unusual patterns like unexpected network calls, file access patterns, or operations that don't match the Skill's stated purpose
- **External sources are risky**: Skills that fetch data from external URLs pose particular risk, as fetched content may contain malicious instructions. Even trustworthy Skills can be compromised if their external dependencies change over time
- **Tool misuse**: Malicious Skills can invoke tools (file operations, bash commands, code execution) in harmful ways
- **Data exposure**: Skills with access to sensitive data could be designed to leak information to external systems
- **Treat like installing software**: Only use Skills from trusted sources. Be especially careful when integrating Skills into production systems with access to sensitive data or critical operations

## Available Skills

### Pre-built Agent Skills

The following pre-built Agent Skills are available for immediate use:

- **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create presentations, edit slides, analyze presentation content
- **Excel (xlsx)**: Create spreadsheets, analyze data, generate reports with charts
- **Word (docx)**: Create documents, edit content, format text
- **PDF (pdf)**: Generate formatted PDF documents and reports

These Skills are available on the Claude API and claude.ai. See the [quickstart tutorial](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart) to start using them in the API.

### Custom Skills examples

For complete examples of custom Skills, see the [Skills cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction).

## Limitations and constraints

Understanding these limitations helps you plan your Skills deployment effectively.

### Cross-surface availability

**Custom Skills do not sync across surfaces**. Skills uploaded to one surface are not automatically available on others:

- Skills uploaded to Claude.ai must be separately uploaded to the API
- Skills uploaded via the API are not available on Claude.ai
- Claude Code Skills are filesystem-based and separate from both Claude.ai and API

You'll need to manage and upload Skills separately for each surface where you want to use them.

### Sharing scope

Skills have different sharing models depending on where you use them:
- **Claude.ai**: Individual user only; each team member must upload separately
- **Claude API**: Workspace-wide; all workspace members can access uploaded Skills
- **Claude Code**: Personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) or project-based (`.claude/skills/`); can also be shared via Claude Code Plugins

Claude.ai does not currently support centralized admin management or org-wide distribution of custom Skills.

### Runtime environment constraints

The exact runtime environment available to your skill depends on the product surface where you use it.

 - **Claude.ai**:
    - **Varying network access**: Depending on user/admin settings, Skills may have full, partial, or no network access. For more details, see the [Create and Edit Files](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_6b7e833898) support article.
- **Claude API**:
    - **No network access**: Skills cannot make external API calls or access the internet
    - **No runtime package installation**: Only pre-installed packages are available. You cannot install new packages during execution.
    - **Pre-configured dependencies only**: Check the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) for the list of available packages
- **Claude Code**:
    - **Full network access**: Skills have the same network access as any other program on the user's computer
    - **Global package installation discouraged**: Skills should only install packages locally in order to avoid interfering with the user's computer

Plan your Skills to work within these constraints.

# Get started with Agent Skills in the API

Learn how to use Agent Skills to create documents with the Claude API in under 10 minutes.

---

This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request, and access the generated file.

## Prerequisites

- [Anthropic API key](/settings/keys)
- Python 3.7+ or curl installed
- Basic familiarity with making API requests

## What are Agent Skills?

Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:

- **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create and edit presentations
- **Excel (xlsx)**: Create and analyze spreadsheets
- **Word (docx)**: Create and edit documents
- **PDF (pdf)**: Generate PDF documents

<Note>
**Want to create custom Skills?** See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.
</Note>

## Step 1: List available Skills

First, let's see what Skills are available. We'll use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# List Anthropic-managed Skills
skills = client.beta.skills.list(
    source="anthropic",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

for skill in skills.data:
    print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

// List Anthropic-managed Skills
const skills = await client.beta.skills.list({
  source: 'anthropic',
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});

for (const skill of skills.data) {
  console.log(`${skill.id}: ${skill.display_title}`);
}
```

```bash Shell
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills?source=anthropic" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
```
</CodeGroup>

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.

This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to know what Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure**, where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.

## Step 2: Create a presentation

Now we'll use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. We specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {
                "type": "anthropic",
                "skill_id": "pptx",
                "version": "latest"
            }
        ]
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
    }],
    tools=[{
        "type": "code_execution_20250825",
        "name": "code_execution"
    }]
)

print(response.content)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

// Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {
        type: 'anthropic',
        skill_id: 'pptx',
        version: 'latest'
      }
    ]
  },
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides'
  }],
  tools: [{
    type: 'code_execution_20250825',
    name: 'code_execution'
  }]
});

console.log(response.content);
```

```bash Shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: code-execution-2025-08-25,skills-2025-10-02" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "container": {
      "skills": [
        {
          "type": "anthropic",
          "skill_id": "pptx",
          "version": "latest"
        }
      ]
    },
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
    }],
    "tools": [{
      "type": "code_execution_20250825",
      "name": "code_execution"
    }]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

Let's break down what each part does:

- **`container.skills`**: Specifies which Skills Claude can use
- **`type: "anthropic"`**: Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
- **`skill_id: "pptx"`**: The PowerPoint Skill identifier
- **`version: "latest"`**: The Skill version set to the most recently published
- **`tools`**: Enables code execution (required for Skills)
- **Beta headers**: `code-execution-2025-08-25` and `skills-2025-10-02`

When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Since you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation.

## Step 3: Download the created file

The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The response includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download it using the Files API:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Extract file ID from response
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':
        # File ID is in the tool result
        for result_block in block.content:
            if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):
                file_id = result_block.file_id
                break

if file_id:
    # Download the file
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(
        file_id=file_id,
        betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
    )

    # Save to disk
    with open("renewable_energy.pptx", "wb") as f:
        file_content.write_to_file(f.name)

    print(f"Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx")
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Extract file ID from response
let fileId: string | null = null;
for (const block of response.content) {
  if (block.type === 'tool_use' && block.name === 'code_execution') {
    // File ID is in the tool result
    for (const resultBlock of block.content) {
      if ('file_id' in resultBlock) {
        fileId = resultBlock.file_id;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}

if (fileId) {
  // Download the file
  const fileContent = await client.beta.files.download(fileId, {
    betas: ['files-api-2025-04-14']
  });

  // Save to disk
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.writeFileSync('renewable_energy.pptx', Buffer.from(await fileContent.arrayBuffer()));

  console.log('Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx');
}
```

```bash Shell
# Extract file_id from response (using jq)
FILE_ID=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.content[] | select(.type=="tool_use" and .name=="code_execution") | .content[] | select(.file_id) | .file_id')

# Download the file
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/$FILE_ID/content" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  --output renewable_energy.pptx

echo "Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
For complete details on working with generated files, see the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#retrieve-generated-files).

## Try more examples

Now that you've created your first document with Skills, try these variations:

### Create a spreadsheet

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",

# Skill authoring best practices

Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use successfully.

---

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The [context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including:
- The system prompt
- Conversation history
- Other Skills' metadata
- Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:
- "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume Claude knows this?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):
````markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
````

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):
```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes Claude knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:
- Multiple approaches are valid
- Decisions depend on context
- Heuristics guide the approach

Example:
```markdown
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:
- A preferred pattern exists
- Some variation is acceptable
- Configuration affects behavior

Example:
````markdown
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
````

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:
- Operations are fragile and error-prone
- Consistency is critical
- A specific sequence must be followed

Example:
````markdown
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

**Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:
- **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
- **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:
- **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
- **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
- **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill structure

<Note>
**YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter requires two fields:

`name`:
- Maximum 64 characters
- Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Cannot contain XML tags
- Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"

`description`:
- Must be non-empty
- Maximum 1024 characters
- Cannot contain XML tags
- Should describe what the Skill does and when to use it

For complete Skill structure details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure).
</Note>

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

Remember that the `name` field must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:
- `processing-pdfs`
- `analyzing-spreadsheets`
- `managing-databases`
- `testing-code`
- `writing-documentation`

**Acceptable alternatives**:
- Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `spreadsheet-analysis`
- Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`

**Avoid**:
- Vague names: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`
- Overly generic: `documents`, `data`, `files`
- Reserved words: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`
- Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Consistent naming makes it easier to:
- Reference Skills in documentation and conversations
- Understand what a Skill does at a glance
- Organize and search through multiple Skills
- Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library

### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

<Warning>
**Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

- **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
- **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
- **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"
</Warning>

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**
```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**
```yaml
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```
```yaml
description: Processes data
```
```yaml
description: Does stuff with files
```

### Progressive disclosure patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide. For an explanation of how progressive disclosure works, see [How Skills work](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the overview.

**Practical guidance:**
- Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
- Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

#### Visual overview: From simple to complex

A basic Skill starts with just a SKILL.md file containing metadata and instructions:

![Simple SKILL.md file showing YAML frontmatter and markdown body](/docs/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png)

As your Skill grows, you can bundle additional content that Claude loads only when needed:

![Bundling additional reference files like reference.md and forms.md.](/docs/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png)

The complete Skill directory structure might look like this:

```
pdf/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions (loaded when triggered)
├── FORMS.md              # Form-filling guide (loaded as needed)
├── reference.md          # API reference (loaded as needed)
├── examples.md           # Usage examples (loaded as needed)
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py   # Utility script (executed, not loaded)
    ├── fill_form.py      # Form filling script
    └── validate.py       # Validation script
```

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

````markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features

**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
````

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only needs to read sales-related schemas, not finance or marketing data. This keeps token usage low and context focused.

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

````markdown SKILL.md
# BigQuery Data Analysis

## Available datasets

**Finance**: Revenue, ARR, billing → See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales**: Opportunities, pipeline, accounts → See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product**: API usage, features, adoption → See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
**Marketing**: Campaigns, attribution, email → See [reference/marketing.md](reference/marketing.md)

## Quick search

Find specific metrics using grep:

```bash
grep -i "revenue" reference/finance.md
grep -i "pipeline" reference/sales.md
grep -i "api usage" reference/product.md
```
````

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

### Avoid deeply nested references

Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, Claude might use commands like `head -100` to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure Claude reads complete files when needed.

**Bad example: Too deep**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)...

# advanced.md
See [details.md](details.md)...

# details.md
Here's the actual information...
```

**Good example: One level deep**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [instructions in SKILL.md]
**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Structure longer reference files with table of contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads.

**Example**:
```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Claude can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed.

For details on how this filesystem-based architecture enables progressive disclosure, see the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section in the Advanced section below.

## Workflows and feedback loops

### Use workflows for complex tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. For particularly complex workflows, provide a checklist that Claude can copy into its response and check off as it progresses.

**Example 1: Research synthesis workflow** (for Skills without code):

````markdown
## Research synthesis workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Research Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read all source documents
- [ ] Step 2: Identify key themes
- [ ] Step 3: Cross-reference claims
- [ ] Step 4: Create structured summary
- [ ] Step 5: Verify citations
```

**Step 1: Read all source documents**

Review each document in the `sources/` directory. Note the main arguments and supporting evidence.

**Step 2: Identify key themes**

Look for patterns across sources. What themes appear repeatedly? Where do sources agree or disagree?

**Step 3: Cross-reference claims**

For each major claim, verify it appears in the source material. Note which source supports each point.

**Step 4: Create structured summary**

Organize findings by theme. Include:
- Main claim
- Supporting evidence from sources
- Conflicting viewpoints (if any)

**Step 5: Verify citations**

Check that every claim references the correct source document. If citations are incomplete, return to Step 3.
````

This example shows how workflows apply to analysis tasks that don't require code. The checklist pattern works for any complex, multi-step process.

**Example 2: PDF form filling workflow** (for Skills with code):

````markdown
## PDF form filling workflow

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

**Step 1: Analyze the form**

Run: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf`

This extracts form fields and their locations, saving to `fields.json`.

**Step 2: Create field mapping**

Edit `fields.json` to add values for each field.

**Step 3: Validate mapping**

Run: `python scripts/validate_fields.py fields.json`

Fix any validation errors before continuing.

**Step 4: Fill the form**

Run: `python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf`

**Step 5: Verify output**

Run: `python scripts/verify_output.py output.pdf`

If verification fails, return to Step 2.
````

Clear steps prevent Claude from skipping critical validation. The checklist helps both Claude and you track progress through multi-step workflows.

### Implement feedback loops

**Common pattern**: Run validator → fix errors → repeat

This pattern greatly improves output quality.

**Example 1: Style guide compliance** (for Skills without code):

```markdown
## Content review process

1. Draft your content following the guidelines in STYLE_GUIDE.md
2. Review against the checklist:
   - Check terminology consistency
   - Verify examples follow the standard format
   - Confirm all required sections are present
3. If issues found:
   - Note each issue with specific section reference
   - Revise the content
   - Review the checklist again
4. Only proceed when all requirements are met
5. Finalize and save the document
```

This shows the validation loop pattern using reference documents instead of scripts. The "validator" is STYLE_GUIDE.md, and Claude performs the check by reading and comparing.

**Example 2: Document editing process** (for Skills with code):

```markdown
## Document editing process

1. Make your edits to `word/document.xml`
2. **Validate immediately**: `python ooxml/scripts/validate.py unpacked_dir/`
3. If validation fails:
   - Review the error message carefully
   - Fix the issues in the XML
   - Run validation again
4. **Only proceed when validation passes**
5. Rebuild: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked_dir/ output.docx`
6. Test the output document
```

The validation loop catches errors early.

## Content guidelines

### Avoid time-sensitive information

Don't include information that will become outdated:

**Bad example: Time-sensitive** (will become wrong):
```markdown
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.
After August 2025, use the new API.
```

**Good example** (use "old patterns" section):
```markdown
## Current method

Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns

<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>

The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`

This endpoint is no longer supported.
</details>
```

The old patterns section provides historical context without cluttering the main content.

### Use consistent terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout the Skill:

**Good - Consistent**:
- Always "API endpoint"
- Always "field"
- Always "extract"

**Bad - Inconsistent**:
- Mix "API endpoint", "URL", "API route", "path"
- Mix "field", "box", "element", "control"
- Mix "extract", "pull", "get", "retrieve"

Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions.

## Common patterns

### Template pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs.

**For strict requirements** (like API responses or data formats):

````markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```
````

**For flexible guidance** (when adaptation is useful):

````markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment based on the analysis:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[Overview]

## Key findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]
```

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
````

### Examples pattern

For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs just like in regular prompting:

````markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
```

**Example 3:**
Input: Updated dependencies and refactored error handling
Output:
```
chore: update dependencies and refactor error handling

- Upgrade lodash to 4.17.21
- Standardize error response format across endpoints
```

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
````

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.

### Conditional workflow pattern

Guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
## Document modification workflow

1. Determine the modification type:

   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow:
   - Use docx-js library
   - Build document from scratch
   - Export to .docx format

3. Editing workflow:
   - Unpack existing document
   - Modify XML directly
   - Validate after each change
   - Repack when complete
```

<Tip>
If workflows become large or complicated with many steps, consider pushing them into separate files and tell Claude to read the appropriate file based on the task at hand.
</Tip>

## Evaluation and iteration

### Build evaluations first

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

**Evaluation-driven development:**
1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context
2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine

This approach ensures you're solving actual problems rather than anticipating requirements that may never materialize.

**Evaluation structure**:
```json
{
  "skills": ["pdf-processing"],
  "query": "Extract all text from this PDF file and save it to output.txt",
  "files": ["test-files/document.pdf"],
  "expected_behavior": [
    "Successfully reads the PDF file using an appropriate PDF processing library or command-line tool",
    "Extracts text content from all pages in the document without missing any pages",
    "Saves the extracted text to a file named output.txt in a clear, readable format"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
This example demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric. We do not currently provide a built-in way to run these evaluations. Users can create their own evaluation system. Evaluations are your source of truth for measuring Skill effectiveness.
</Note>

### Develop Skills iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B"). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests them in real tasks. This works because Claude models understand both how to write effective agent instructions and what information agents need.

**Creating a new Skill:**

1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting. As you work, you'll naturally provide context, explain preferences, and share procedural knowledge. Notice what information you repeatedly provide.

2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks.

   **Example**: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table names, field definitions, filtering rules (like "always exclude test accounts"), and common query patterns.

3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule about filtering test accounts."

   <Tip>
   Claude models understand the Skill format and structure natively. You don't need special system prompts or a "writing skills" skill to get Claude to help create Skills. Simply ask Claude to create a Skill and it will generate properly structured SKILL.md content with appropriate frontmatter and body content.
   </Tip>

4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations. Ask: "Remove the explanation about what win rate means - Claude already knows that."

5. **Improve information architecture**: Ask Claude A to organize the content more effectively. For example: "Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference file. We might add more tables later."

6. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information, applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully.

7. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles or misses something, return to Claude A with specifics: "When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for Q4. Should we add a section about date filtering patterns?"

**Iterating on existing Skills:**

The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between:
- **Working with Claude A** (the expert who helps refine the Skill)
- **Testing with Claude B** (the agent using the Skill to perform real work)
- **Observing Claude B's behavior** and bringing insights back to Claude A

1. **Use the Skill in real workflows**: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks, not test scenarios

2. **Observe Claude B's behavior**: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices

   **Example observation**: "When I asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule."

3. **Return to Claude A for improvements**: Share the current SKILL.md and describe what you observed. Ask: "I noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when I asked for a regional report. The Skill mentions filtering, but maybe it's not prominent enough?"

4. **Review Claude A's suggestions**: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules more prominent, using stronger language like "MUST filter" instead of "always filter", or restructuring the workflow section.

5. **Apply and test changes**: Update the Skill with Claude A's refinements, then test again with Claude B on similar requests

6. **Repeat based on usage**: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as you encounter new scenarios. Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior, not assumptions.

**Gathering team feedback:**

1. Share Skills with teammates and observe their usage
2. Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing?
3. Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns

**Why this approach works**: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain expertise, Claude B reveals gaps through real usage, and iterative refinement improves Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

### Observe how Claude navigates Skills

As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice. Watch for:

- **Unexpected exploration paths**: Does Claude read files in an order you didn't anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought
- **Missed connections**: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your links might need to be more explicit or prominent
- **Overreliance on certain sections**: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file, consider whether that content should be in the main SKILL.md instead
- **Ignored content**: If Claude never accesses a bundled file, it might be unnecessary or poorly signaled in the main instructions

Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions. The 'name' and 'description' in your Skill's metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when deciding whether to trigger the Skill in response to the current task. Make sure they clearly describe what the Skill does and when it should be used.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### Avoid Windows-style paths

Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows:

- ✓ **Good**: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
- ✗ **Avoid**: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style paths cause errors on Unix systems.

### Avoid offering too many options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

````markdown
**Bad example: Too many choices** (confusing):
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image, or..."

**Good example: Provide a default** (with escape hatch):
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."
````

## Advanced: Skills with executable code

The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, skip to [Checklist for effective Skills](#checklist-for-effective-skills).

### Solve, don't punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

**Good example: Handle errors explicitly**:
```python
def process_file(path):
    """Process a file, creating it if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Create file with default content instead of failing
        print(f"File {path} not found, creating default")
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('')
        return ''
    except PermissionError:
        # Provide alternative instead of failing
        print(f"Cannot access {path}, using default")
        return ''
```

**Bad example: Punt to Claude**:
```python
def process_file(path):
    # Just fail and let Claude figure it out
    return open(path).read()
```

Configuration parameters should also be justified and documented to avoid "voodoo constants" (Ousterhout's law). If you don't know the right value, how will Claude determine it?

**Good example: Self-documenting**:
```python
# HTTP requests typically complete within 30 seconds
# Longer timeout accounts for slow connections
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30

# Three retries balances reliability vs speed
# Most intermittent failures resolve by the second retry
MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

**Bad example: Magic numbers**:
```python
TIMEOUT = 47  # Why 47?
RETRIES = 5   # Why 5?
```

### Provide utility scripts

Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages:

**Benefits of utility scripts**:
- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
- Save time (no code generation required)
- Ensure consistency across uses

![Bundling executable scripts alongside instruction files](/docs/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png)

The diagram above shows how executable scripts work alongside instruction files. The instruction file (forms.md) references the script, and Claude can execute it without loading its contents into context.

**Important distinction**: Make clear in your instructions whether Claude should:
- **Execute the script** (most common): "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields"
- **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): "See `analyze_form.py` for the field extraction algorithm"

For most utility scripts, execution is preferred because it's more reliable and efficient. See the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section below for details on how script execution works.

**Example**:
````markdown
## Utility scripts

**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF

```bash
python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json
```

Output format:
```json
{
  "field_name": {"type": "text", "x": 100, "y": 200},
  "signature": {"type": "sig", "x": 150, "y": 500}
}
```

**validate_boxes.py**: Check for overlapping bounding boxes

```bash
python scripts/validate_boxes.py fields.json
# Returns: "OK" or lists conflicts
```

**fill_form.py**: Apply field values to PDF

```bash
python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf
```
````

### Use visual analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them:

````markdown
## Form layout analysis

1. Convert PDF to images:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf
   ```

2. Analyze each page image to identify form fields
3. Claude can see field locations and types visually
````

<Note>
In this example, you'd need to write the `pdf_to_images.py` script.
</Note>

Claude's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures.

### Create verifiable intermediate outputs

When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes. The "plan-validate-execute" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it.

**Example**: Imagine asking Claude to update 50 form fields in a PDF based on a spreadsheet. Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly.

**Solution**: Use the workflow pattern shown above (PDF form filling), but add an intermediate `changes.json` file that gets validated before applying changes. The workflow becomes: analyze → **create plan file** → **validate plan** → execute → verify.

**Why this pattern works:**
- **Catches errors early**: Validation finds problems before changes are applied
- **Machine-verifiable**: Scripts provide objective verification
- **Reversible planning**: Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals
- **Clear debugging**: Error messages point to specific problems

**When to use**: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

**Implementation tip**: Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like "Field 'signature_date' not found. Available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed" to help Claude fix issues.

### Package dependencies

Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:

- **claude.ai**: Can install packages from npm and PyPI and pull from GitHub repositories
- **Anthropic API**: Has no network access and no runtime package installation

List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available in the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool).

### Runtime environment

Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. For the conceptual explanation of this architecture, see [The Skills architecture](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#the-skills-architecture) in the overview.

**How this affects your authoring:**

**How Claude accesses Skills:**

1. **Metadata pre-loaded**: At startup, the name and description from all Skills' YAML frontmatter are loaded into the system prompt
2. **Files read on-demand**: Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILL.md and other files from the filesystem when needed
3. **Scripts executed efficiently**: Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading their full contents into context. Only the script's output consumes tokens
4. **No context penalty for large files**: Reference files, data, or documentation don't consume context tokens until actually read

- **File paths matter**: Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem. Use forward slashes (`reference/guide.md`), not backslashes
- **Name files descriptively**: Use names that indicate content: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`
- **Organize for discovery**: Structure directories by domain or feature
  - Good: `reference/finance.md`, `reference/sales.md`
  - Bad: `docs/file1.md`, `docs/file2.md`
- **Bundle comprehensive resources**: Include complete API docs, extensive examples, large datasets; no context penalty until accessed
- **Prefer scripts for deterministic operations**: Write `validate_form.py` rather than asking Claude to generate validation code
- **Make execution intent clear**:
  - "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields" (execute)
  - "See `analyze_form.py` for the extraction algorithm" (read as reference)
- **Test file access patterns**: Verify Claude can navigate your directory structure by testing with real requests

**Example:**

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview, points to reference files)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue metrics)
    ├── sales.md (pipeline data)
    └── product.md (usage analytics)
```

When the user asks about revenue, Claude reads SKILL.md, sees the reference to `reference/finance.md`, and invokes bash to read just that file. The sales.md and product.md files remain on the filesystem, consuming zero context tokens until needed. This filesystem-based model is what enables progressive disclosure. Claude can navigate and selectively load exactly what each task requires.

For complete details on the technical architecture, see [How Skills work](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the Skills overview.

### MCP tool references

If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names to avoid "tool not found" errors.

**Format**: `ServerName:tool_name`

**Example**:
```markdown
Use the BigQuery:bigquery_schema tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the GitHub:create_issue tool to create issues.
```

Where:
- `BigQuery` and `GitHub` are MCP server names
- `bigquery_schema` and `create_issue` are the tool names within those servers

Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool, especially when multiple MCP servers are available.

### Avoid assuming tools are installed

Don't assume packages are available:

````markdown
**Bad example: Assumes installation**:
"Use the pdf library to process the file."

**Good example: Explicit about dependencies**:
"Install required package: `pip install pypdf`

Then use it:
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")
```"
````

## Technical notes

### YAML frontmatter requirements

The SKILL.md frontmatter requires `name` and `description` fields with specific validation rules:
- `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words
- `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

See the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure) for complete structure details.

### Token budgets

Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split it into separate files using the progressive disclosure patterns described earlier. For architectural details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work).

# Skills for enterprise

Governance, security review, evaluation, and organizational guidance for deploying Agent Skills at enterprise scale.

---

This guide is for enterprise admins and architects who need to govern Agent Skills across an organization. It covers how to vet, evaluate, deploy, and manage Skills at scale. For authoring guidance, see [best practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices). For architecture details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Security review and vetting

Deploying Skills in an enterprise requires answering two distinct questions:

1. **Are Skills safe in general?** See the [security considerations](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#security-considerations) section in the overview for platform-level security details.
2. **How do I vet a specific Skill?** Use the risk assessment and review checklist below.

### Risk tier assessment

Evaluate each Skill against these risk indicators before approving deployment:

| Risk indicator | What to look for | Concern level |
|---|---|---|
| Code execution | Scripts in the Skill directory (`*.py`, `*.sh`, `*.js`) | High: scripts run with full environment access |
| Instruction manipulation | Directives to ignore safety rules, hide actions from users, or alter Claude's behavior conditionally | High: can bypass security controls |
| MCP server references | Instructions referencing MCP tools (`ServerName:tool_name`) | High: extends access beyond the Skill itself |
| Network access patterns | URLs, API endpoints, `fetch`, `curl`, or `requests` calls | High: potential data exfiltration vector |
| Hardcoded credentials | API keys, tokens, or passwords in Skill files or scripts | High: secrets exposed in Git history and context window |
| File system access scope | Paths outside the Skill directory, broad glob patterns, path traversal (`../`) | Medium: may access unintended data |
| Tool invocations | Instructions directing Claude to use bash, file operations, or other tools | Medium: review what operations are performed |

### Review checklist

Before deploying any Skill from a third party or internal contributor, complete these steps:

1. **Read all Skill directory content.** Review SKILL.md, all referenced markdown files, and any bundled scripts or resources.
2. **Verify script behavior matches stated purpose.** Run scripts in a sandboxed environment and confirm outputs align with the Skill's description.
3. **Check for adversarial instructions.** Look for directives that tell Claude to ignore safety rules, hide actions from users, exfiltrate data through responses, or alter behavior based on specific inputs.
4. **Check for external URL fetches or network calls.** Search scripts and instructions for network access patterns (`http`, `requests.get`, `urllib`, `curl`, `fetch`).
5. **Verify no hardcoded credentials.** Check for API keys, tokens, or passwords in Skill files. Credentials should use environment variables or secure credential stores, never appear in Skill content.
6. **Identify tools and commands the Skill instructs Claude to invoke.** List all bash commands, file operations, and tool references. Consider the combined risk when a Skill uses both file-read and network tools together.
7. **Confirm redirect destinations.** If the Skill references external URLs, verify they point to expected domains.
8. **Verify no data exfiltration patterns.** Look for instructions that read sensitive data and then write, send, or encode it for external transmission, including through Claude's conversational responses.

<Warning>
Never deploy Skills from untrusted sources without a full audit. A malicious Skill can direct Claude to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive files, or transmit data externally. Treat Skill installation with the same rigor as installing software on production systems.
</Warning>

## Evaluating Skills before deployment

Skills can degrade agent performance if they trigger incorrectly, conflict with other Skills, or provide poor instructions. Require evaluation before any production deployment.

### What to evaluate

Establish approval gates for these dimensions before deploying any Skill:

| Dimension | What it measures | Example failure |
|---|---|---|
| Triggering accuracy | Does the Skill activate for the right queries and stay inactive for unrelated ones? | Skill triggers on every spreadsheet mention, even when the user just wants to discuss data |
| Isolation behavior | Does the Skill work correctly on its own? | Skill references files that don't exist in its directory |
| Coexistence | Does adding this Skill degrade other Skills? | New Skill's description is too broad, stealing triggers from existing Skills |
| Instruction following | Does Claude follow the Skill's instructions accurately? | Claude skips validation steps or uses wrong libraries |
| Output quality | Does the Skill produce correct, useful results? | Generated reports have formatting errors or missing data |

### Evaluation requirements

Require Skill authors to submit evaluation suites with 3-5 representative queries per Skill, covering cases where the Skill should trigger, should not trigger, and ambiguous edge cases. Require testing across the models your organization uses (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), since Skill effectiveness varies by model.

For detailed guidance on building evaluations, see [evaluation and iteration](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#evaluation-and-iteration) in best practices. For general evaluation methodology, see [develop test cases](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests).

### Using evaluations for lifecycle decisions

Evaluation results signal when to act:

- **Declining trigger accuracy:** Update the Skill's description or instructions
- **Coexistence conflicts:** Consolidate overlapping Skills or narrow descriptions
- **Consistently low output quality:** Rewrite instructions or add validation steps
- **Persistent failures across updates:** Deprecate the Skill

## Skill lifecycle management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan">
    Identify workflows that are repetitive, error-prone, or require specialized knowledge. Map these to organizational roles and determine which are candidates for Skills.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and review">
    Ensure the Skill author follows [best practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices). Require a security review using the [review checklist](#review-checklist) above. Require an evaluation suite before approval. Establish separation of duties: Skill authors should not be their own reviewers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Require evaluations in isolation (Skill alone) and alongside existing Skills (coexistence testing). Verify triggering accuracy, output quality, and absence of regressions across your active Skill set before approving for production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Upload via the Skills API for workspace-wide access. See [Using Skills with the API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) for upload and version management. Document the Skill in your internal registry with purpose, owner, and version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Track usage patterns and collect feedback from users. Re-run evaluations periodically to detect drift or regressions as workflows and models evolve. Usage analytics are not currently available via the Skills API. Implement application-level logging to track which Skills are included in requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate or deprecate">
    Require the full evaluation suite to pass before promoting new versions. Update Skills when workflows change or evaluation scores decline. Deprecate Skills when evaluations consistently fail or the workflow is retired.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing Skills at scale

### Recall limits

As a general guideline, limit the number of Skills loaded simultaneously to maintain reliable recall accuracy. Each Skill's metadata (name and description) competes for attention in the system prompt. With too many Skills active, Claude may fail to select the right Skill or miss relevant ones entirely. Use your evaluation suite to measure recall accuracy as you add Skills, and stop adding when performance degrades.

Note that API requests support a maximum of 8 Skills per request (see [Using Skills with the API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide)). If a role requires more Skills than a single request supports, consider consolidating narrow Skills into broader ones or routing requests to different Skill sets based on task type.

### Start specific, consolidate later

Encourage teams to start with narrow, workflow-specific Skills rather than broad, multi-purpose ones. As patterns emerge across your organization, consolidate related Skills into role-based bundles.

<Tip>
Use evaluations to decide when to consolidate. Merge narrow Skills into a broader one only when the consolidated Skill's evaluations confirm equivalent performance to the individual Skills it replaces.
</Tip>

**Example progression**:
- Start: `formatting-sales-reports`, `querying-pipeline-data`, `updating-crm-records`
- Consolidate: `sales-operations` (when evals confirm equivalent performance)

### Naming and cataloging

Use consistent naming conventions across your organization. The [naming conventions](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#naming-conventions) section in best practices provides formatting guidance.

Maintain an internal registry for each Skill with:
- **Purpose**: What workflow the Skill supports
- **Owner**: Team or individual responsible for maintenance
- **Version**: Current deployed version
- **Dependencies**: MCP servers, packages, or external services required
- **Evaluation status**: Last evaluation date and results

### Role-based bundles

Group Skills by organizational role to keep each user's active Skill set focused:

- **Sales team**: CRM operations, pipeline reporting, proposal generation
- **Engineering**: Code review, deployment workflows, incident response
- **Finance**: Report generation, data validation, audit preparation

Each role-based bundle should contain only the Skills relevant to that role's daily workflows.

## Distribution and version control

### Source control

Store Skill directories in Git for history tracking, code review via pull requests, and rollback capability. Each Skill directory (containing SKILL.md and any bundled files) maps naturally to a Git-tracked folder.

### API-based distribution

The Skills API provides workspace-scoped distribution. Skills uploaded via the API are available to all workspace members. See [Using Skills with the API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) for upload, versioning, and management endpoints.

### Versioning strategy

- **Production**: Pin Skills to specific versions. Run the full evaluation suite before promoting a new version. Treat every update as a new deployment requiring full security review.
- **Development and testing**: Use latest versions to validate changes before production promotion.
- **Rollback plan**: Maintain the previous version as a fallback. If a new version fails evaluations in production, revert to the last known-good version immediately.
- **Integrity verification**: Compute checksums of reviewed Skills and verify them at deployment time. Use signed commits in your Skill repository to ensure provenance.

### Cross-surface considerations

<Warning>
Custom Skills do not sync across surfaces. Skills uploaded to the API are not available on claude.ai or in Claude Code, and vice versa. Each surface requires separate uploads and management.
</Warning>

Maintain Skill source files in Git as the single source of truth. If your organization deploys Skills across multiple surfaces, implement your own synchronization process to keep them consistent. For full details, see [cross-surface availability](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#cross-surface-availability).

# Using Agent Skills with the API

Learn how to use Agent Skills to extend Claude's capabilities through the API.

Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities through organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources. This guide shows you how to use both pre-built and custom Skills with the Claude API.

## Overview

<Note>
For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

Skills integrate with the Messages API through the code execution tool. Whether using pre-built Skills managed by Anthropic or custom Skills you've uploaded, the integration shape is identical—both require code execution and use the same `container` structure.

### Using Skills

Skills integrate identically in the Messages API regardless of source. You specify Skills in the `container` parameter with a `skill_id`, `type`, and optional `version`, and they execute in the code execution environment.

**You can use Skills from two sources:**

| Aspect | Anthropic Skills | Custom Skills |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Type value** | `anthropic` | `custom` |
| **Skill IDs** | Short names: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pdf` | Generated: `skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv` |
| **Version format** | Date-based: `20251013` or `latest` | Epoch timestamp: `1759178010641129` or `latest` |
| **Management** | Pre-built and maintained by Anthropic | Upload and manage via [Skills API](/docs/en/api/skills/create-skill) |
| **Availability** | Available to all users | Private to your workspace |

Both skill sources are returned by the [List Skills endpoint](/docs/en/api/skills/list-skills) (use the `source` parameter to filter). The integration shape and execution environment are identical—the only difference is where the Skills come from and how they're managed.

### Prerequisites

To use Skills, you need:

1. **Anthropic API key** from the [Console](/settings/keys)
2. **Beta headers**:
   - `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Enables code execution (required for Skills)
   - `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills API
   - `files-api-2025-04-14` - For uploading/downloading files to/from container
3. **Code execution tool** enabled in your requests

---

## Using Skills in Messages

### Container Parameter

Skills are specified using the `container` parameter in the Messages API. You can include up to 8 Skills per request.

The structure is identical for both Anthropic and custom Skills—specify the required `type` and `skill_id`, and optionally include `version` to pin to a specific version:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {
                "type": "anthropic",
                "skill_id": "pptx",
                "version": "latest"
            }
        ]
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy"
    }],
    tools=[{
        "type": "code_execution_20250825",
        "name": "code_execution"
    }]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {
        type: 'anthropic',
        skill_id: 'pptx',
        version: 'latest'
      }
    ]
  },
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Create a presentation about renewable energy'
  }],
  tools: [{
    type: 'code_execution_20250825',
    name: 'code_execution'
  }]
});
```

```bash Shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \

        }
      ]
    },

      "name": "code_execution"
    }]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Downloading Generated Files

When Skills create documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word), they return `file_id` attributes in the response. You must use the Files API to download these files.

**How it works:**
1. Skills create files during code execution
2. Response includes `file_id` for each created file
3. Use Files API to download the actual file content
4. Save locally or process as needed

**Example: Creating and downloading an Excel file**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Step 1: Use a Skill to create a file
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create an Excel file with a simple budget spreadsheet"
    }],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)

# Step 2: Extract file IDs from the response
def extract_file_ids(response):
    file_ids = []
    for item in response.content:
        if item.type == 'bash_code_execution_tool_result':
            content_item = item.content
            if content_item.type == 'bash_code_execution_result':
                for file in content_item.content:
                    if hasattr(file, 'file_id'):
                        file_ids.append(file.file_id)
    return file_ids

# Step 3: Download the file using Files API
for file_id in extract_file_ids(response):
    file_metadata = client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(
        file_id=file_id,
        betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
    )
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(
        file_id=file_id,
        betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
    )

    # Step 4: Save to disk
    file_content.write_to_file(file_metadata.filename)
    print(f"Downloaded: {file_metadata.filename}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

// Step 1: Use a Skill to create a file
const response = await client.beta.messages.create({

  container: {
    skills: [
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'xlsx', version: 'latest'}
    ]
  },
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Create an Excel file with a simple budget spreadsheet'
  }],
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});

// Step 2: Extract file IDs from the response
function extractFileIds(response: any): string[] {
  const fileIds: string[] = [];
  for (const item of response.content) {

      const contentItem = item.content;
      if (contentItem.type === 'bash_code_execution_result') {
        for (const file of contentItem.content) {
          if ('file_id' in file) {
            fileIds.push(file.file_id);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return fileIds;
}

// Step 3: Download the file using Files API
const fs = require('fs');
for (const fileId of extractFileIds(response)) {
  const fileMetadata = await client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(fileId, {
    betas: ['files-api-2025-04-14']
  });
  const fileContent = await client.beta.files.download(fileId, {
    betas: ['files-api-2025-04-14']
  });

  // Step 4: Save to disk
  fs.writeFileSync(fileMetadata.filename, Buffer.from(await fileContent.arrayBuffer()));
  console.log(`Downloaded: ${fileMetadata.filename}`);
}
```

```bash Shell

**Additional Files API operations:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Get file metadata
file_info = client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(
    file_id=file_id,
    betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
)
print(f"Filename: {file_info.filename}, Size: {file_info.size_bytes} bytes")

# List all files
files = client.beta.files.list(betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"])

### Multi-Turn Conversations

Reuse the same container across multiple messages by specifying the container ID:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# First request creates container
response1 = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this sales data"}],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)

# Continue conversation with same container
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this sales data"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": response1.content},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What was the total revenue?"}
]

response2 = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "id": response1.container.id,  # Reuse container
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    messages=messages,
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// First request creates container
const response1 = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'xlsx', version: 'latest'}
    ]
  },
  messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this sales data'}],
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});

// Continue conversation with same container
const messages = [
  {role: 'user', content: 'Analyze this sales data'},
  {role: 'assistant', content: response1.content},
  {role: 'user', content: 'What was the total revenue?'}
];

const response2 = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    id: response1.container.id,  // Reuse container
    skills: [
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'xlsx', version: 'latest'}
    ]
  },
  messages,
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Long-Running Operations

Skills may perform operations that require multiple turns. Handle `pause_turn` stop reasons:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Process this large dataset"}]
max_retries = 10

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    messages=messages,
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)

# Handle pause_turn for long operations
for i in range(max_retries):
    if response.stop_reason != "pause_turn":
        break

    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
    response = client.beta.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        max_tokens=4096,
        betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
        container={
            "id": response.container.id,
            "skills": [
                {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
            ]
        },
        messages=messages,
        tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
    )
```

```typescript TypeScript
let messages = [{role: 'user' as const, content: 'Process this large dataset'}];
const maxRetries = 10;

let response = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {type: 'custom', skill_id: 'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv', version: 'latest'}
    ]
  },
  messages,
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});

// Handle pause_turn for long operations
for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
  if (response.stop_reason !== 'pause_turn') {
    break;
  }

  messages.push({role: 'assistant', content: response.content});
  response = await client.beta.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      id: response.container.id,
      skills: [
        {type: 'custom', skill_id: 'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv', version: 'latest'}
      ]
    },
    messages,
    tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
  });

  STOP_REASON=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.stop_reason')
done
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The response may include a `pause_turn` stop reason, which indicates that the API paused a long-running Skill operation. You can provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let Claude continue its turn, or modify the content if you wish to interrupt the conversation and provide additional guidance.
</Note>

### Using Multiple Skills

Combine multiple Skills in a single request to handle complex workflows:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={

## Managing Custom Skills

### Creating a Skill

Upload your custom Skill to make it available in your workspace. You can upload using either a directory path or individual file objects.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Option 1: Using files_from_dir helper (Python only, recommended)
from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

skill = client.beta.skills.create(
    display_title="Financial Analysis",
    files=files_from_dir("/path/to/financial_analysis_skill"),
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

# Option 2: Using a zip file
skill = client.beta.skills.create(
    display_title="Financial Analysis",
    files=[("skill.zip", open("financial_analysis_skill.zip", "rb"))],
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

# Option 3: Using file tuples (filename, file_content, mime_type)
skill = client.beta.skills.create(
    display_title="Financial Analysis",
    files=[
        ("financial_skill/SKILL.md", open("financial_skill/SKILL.md", "rb"), "text/markdown"),
        ("financial_skill/analyze.py", open("financial_skill/analyze.py", "rb"), "text/x-python"),
    ],
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

print(f"Created skill: {skill.id}")
print(f"Latest version: {skill.latest_version}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic, { toFile } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import fs from 'fs';

const client = new Anthropic();

// Option 1: Using a zip file
const skill = await client.beta.skills.create({
  displayTitle: 'Financial Analysis',
  files: [
    await toFile(
      fs.createReadStream('financial_analysis_skill.zip'),
      'skill.zip'
    )
  ],
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});

// Option 2: Using individual file objects
const skill = await client.beta.skills.create({
  displayTitle: 'Financial Analysis',
  files: [
    await toFile(
      fs.createReadStream('financial_skill/SKILL.md'),
      'financial_skill/SKILL.md',
      { type: 'text/markdown' }
    ),
    await toFile(
      fs.createReadStream('financial_skill/analyze.py'),
      'financial_skill/analyze.py',
      { type: 'text/x-python' }
    ),
  ],
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});

console.log(`Created skill: ${skill.id}`);
console.log(`Latest version: ${skill.latest_version}`);
```

```bash Shell
curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02" \
  -F "display_title=Financial Analysis" \
  -F "files[]=@financial_skill/SKILL.md;filename=financial_skill/SKILL.md" \
  -F "files[]=@financial_skill/analyze.py;filename=financial_skill/analyze.py"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Requirements:**
- Must include a SKILL.md file at the top level
- All files must specify a common root directory in their paths
- Total upload size must be under 8MB
- YAML frontmatter requirements:
  - `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words ("anthropic", "claude")
  - `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

For complete request/response schemas, see the [Create Skill API reference](/docs/en/api/skills/create-skill).

### Listing Skills

Retrieve all Skills available to your workspace, including both Anthropic pre-built Skills and your custom Skills. Use the `source` parameter to filter by skill type:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# List all Skills
skills = client.beta.skills.list(
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

for skill in skills.data:
    print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title} (source: {skill.source})")

# List only custom Skills
custom_skills = client.beta.skills.list(
    source="custom",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// List all Skills
const skills = await client.beta.skills.list({
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});

for (const skill of skills.data) {
  console.log(`${skill.id}: ${skill.display_title} (source: ${skill.source})`);
}

// List only custom Skills
const customSkills = await client.beta.skills.list({
  source: 'custom',
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});
```

```bash Shell
# List all Skills
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"

# List only custom Skills
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills?source=custom" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [List Skills API reference](/docs/en/api/skills/list-skills) for pagination and filtering options.

### Retrieving a Skill

Get details about a specific Skill:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
skill = client.beta.skills.retrieve(
    skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

print(f"Skill: {skill.display_title}")
print(f"Latest version: {skill.latest_version}")
print(f"Created: {skill.created_at}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const skill = await client.beta.skills.retrieve(
  'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
  { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
);

console.log(`Skill: ${skill.display_title}`);
console.log(`Latest version: ${skill.latest_version}`);
console.log(`Created: ${skill.created_at}`);
```

```bash Shell
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills/skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Deleting a Skill

To delete a Skill, you must first delete all its versions:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Step 1: Delete all versions
versions = client.beta.skills.versions.list(
    skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

for version in versions.data:
    client.beta.skills.versions.delete(
        skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
        version=version.version,
        betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
    )

# Step 2: Delete the Skill
client.beta.skills.delete(
    skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Step 1: Delete all versions
const versions = await client.beta.skills.versions.list(
  'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
  { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
);

for (const version of versions.data) {
  await client.beta.skills.versions.delete(
    'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
    version.version,
    { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
  );
}

// Step 2: Delete the Skill
await client.beta.skills.delete(
  'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv',
  { betas: ['skills-2025-10-02'] }
);
```

```bash Shell
# Delete all versions first, then delete the Skill
curl -X DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills/skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02"
```
</CodeGroup>

Attempting to delete a Skill with existing versions will return a 400 error.

### Versioning

Skills support versioning to manage updates safely:

**Anthropic-Managed Skills**:
- Versions use date format: `20251013`
- New versions released as updates are made
- Specify exact versions for stability

**Custom Skills**:
- Auto-generated epoch timestamps: `1759178010641129`
- Use `"latest"` to always get the most recent version
- Create new versions when updating Skill files

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create a new version
from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

new_version = client.beta.skills.versions.create(
    skill_id="skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
    files=files_from_dir("/path/to/updated_skill"),
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]

## How Skills Are Loaded

When you specify Skills in a container:

1. **Metadata Discovery**: Claude sees metadata for each Skill (name, description) in the system prompt
2. **File Loading**: Skill files are copied into the container at `/skills/{directory}/`
3. **Automatic Use**: Claude automatically loads and uses Skills when relevant to your request
4. **Composition**: Multiple Skills compose together for complex workflows

The progressive disclosure architecture ensures efficient context usage—Claude only loads full Skill instructions when needed.

  - `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

### Environment Constraints
Skills run in the code execution container with these limitations:
- **No network access** - Cannot make external API calls
- **No runtime package installation** - Only pre-installed packages available
- **Isolated environment** - Each request gets a fresh container

See the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) for available packages.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Multiple Skills

Combine Skills when tasks involve multiple document types or domains:

**Good use cases:**
- Data analysis (Excel) + presentation creation (PowerPoint)
- Report generation (Word) + export to PDF
- Custom domain logic + document generation

**Avoid:**
- Including unused Skills (impacts performance)

### Version Management Strategy

**For production:**
```python
# Pin to specific versions for stability
container={
    "skills": [{
        "type": "custom",
        "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
        "version": "1759178010641129"  # Specific version
    }]
}
```

**For development:**
```python
# Use latest for active development
container={
    "skills": [{
        "type": "custom",
        "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
        "version": "latest"  # Always get newest
    }]
}
```

### Prompt Caching Considerations

When using prompt caching, note that changing the Skills list in your container will break the cache:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# First request creates cache
response1 = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02", "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}
        ]
    },
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze sales data"}],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)

# Adding/removing Skills breaks cache
response2 = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02", "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"},
            {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "pptx", "version": "latest"}  # Cache miss
        ]
    },
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Create a presentation"}],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// First request creates cache
const response1 = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02', 'prompt-caching-2024-07-31'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'xlsx', version: 'latest'}
    ]
  },
  messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Analyze sales data'}],
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});

// Adding/removing Skills breaks cache
const response2 = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02', 'prompt-caching-2024-07-31'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'xlsx', version: 'latest'},
      {type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'pptx', version: 'latest'}  // Cache miss
    ]
  },
  messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Create a presentation'}],
  tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
});
```

```bash Shell
# First request creates cache
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

      ]
    },
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze sales data"}],
    "tools": [{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]

  -d '{
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "container": {
      "skills": [
        {"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"},

    "tools": [{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

For best caching performance, keep your Skills list consistent across requests.

### Error Handling

Handle Skill-related errors gracefully:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
try:
    response = client.beta.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        max_tokens=4096,
        betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
        container={
            "skills": [
                {"type": "custom", "skill_id": "skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv", "version": "latest"}
            ]
        },
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Process data"}],
        tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}]
    )
except anthropic.BadRequestError as e:
    if "skill" in str(e):
        print(f"Skill error: {e}")
        # Handle skill-specific errors
    else:
        raise
```

```typescript TypeScript
try {
  const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
    max_tokens: 4096,
    betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
    container: {
      skills: [
        {type: 'custom', skill_id: 'skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv', version: 'latest'}
      ]
    },
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'Process data'}],
    tools: [{type: 'code_execution_20250825', name: 'code_execution'}]
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Anthropic.BadRequestError && error.message.includes('skill')) {
    console.error(`Skill error: ${error.message}`);
    // Handle skill-specific errors
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

# Agent SDK overview

Build production AI agents with Claude Code as a library

---

<Note>
The Claude Code SDK has been renamed to the Claude Agent SDK. If you're migrating from the old SDK, see the [Migration Guide](/docs/en/agent-sdk/migration-guide).
</Note>

Build AI agents that autonomously read files, run commands, search the web, edit code, and more. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Find and fix the bug in auth.py",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Bash"])
    ):
        print(message)  # Claude reads the file, finds the bug, edits it

asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Find and fix the bug in auth.py",
  options: { allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Bash"] }
})) {
  console.log(message);  // Claude reads the file, finds the bug, edits it
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The Agent SDK includes built-in tools for reading files, running commands, and editing code, so your agent can start working immediately without you implementing tool execution. Dive into the quickstart or explore real agents built with the SDK:

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="TypeScript">
        ```bash
        npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```bash
        pip install claude-agent-sdk
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your API key">
    Get an API key from the [Console](https://platform.claude.com/), then set it as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    The SDK also supports authentication via third-party API providers:

    - **Amazon Bedrock**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` environment variable and configure AWS credentials
    - **Google Vertex AI**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials
    - **Microsoft Azure**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1` environment variable and configure Azure credentials

    See the setup guides for [Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Azure AI Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/azure-ai-foundry) for details.

    <Note>
    Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your first agent">
    This example creates an agent that lists files in your current directory using built-in tools.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="What files are in this directory?",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Bash", "Glob"])
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "What files are in this directory?",
      options: { allowedTools: ["Bash", "Glob"] },
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Capabilities

Everything that makes Claude Code powerful is available in the SDK:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Built-in tools">
    Your agent can read files, run commands, and search codebases out of the box. Key tools include:

    | Tool | What it does |
    |------|--------------|
    | **Read** | Read any file in the working directory |
    | **Write** | Create new files |
    | **Edit** | Make precise edits to existing files |
    | **Bash** | Run terminal commands, scripts, git operations |
    | **Glob** | Find files by pattern (`**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.py`) |
    | **Grep** | Search file contents with regex |
    | **WebSearch** | Search the web for current information |
    | **WebFetch** | Fetch and parse web page content |
    | **[AskUserQuestion](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions)** | Ask the user clarifying questions with multiple choice options |

    This example creates an agent that searches your codebase for TODO comments:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Find all TODO comments and create a summary",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"])
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Find all TODO comments and create a summary",
      options: { allowedTools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"] }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hooks">
    Run custom code at key points in the agent lifecycle. SDK hooks use callback functions to validate, log, block, or transform agent behavior.

    **Available hooks:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and more.

    This example logs all file changes to an audit file:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from datetime import datetime
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher

    async def log_file_change(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
        file_path = input_data.get('tool_input', {}).get('file_path', 'unknown')
        with open('./audit.log', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{datetime.now()}: modified {file_path}\n")
        return {}

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Refactor utils.py to improve readability",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                permission_mode="acceptEdits",
                hooks={
                    "PostToolUse": [HookMatcher(matcher="Edit|Write", hooks=[log_file_change])]
                }
            )
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query, HookCallback } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
    import { appendFileSync } from "fs";

    const logFileChange: HookCallback = async (input) => {
      const filePath = (input as any).tool_input?.file_path ?? "unknown";
      appendFileSync("./audit.log", `${new Date().toISOString()}: modified ${filePath}\n`);
      return {};
    };

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Refactor utils.py to improve readability",
      options: {
        permissionMode: "acceptEdits",
        hooks: {
          PostToolUse: [{ matcher: "Edit|Write", hooks: [logFileChange] }]
        }
      }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [Learn more about hooks →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    Spawn specialized agents to handle focused subtasks. Your main agent delegates work, and subagents report back with results.

    Define custom agents with specialized instructions. Include `Task` in `allowedTools` since subagents are invoked via the Task tool:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AgentDefinition

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Use the code-reviewer agent to review this codebase",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Task"],
                agents={
                    "code-reviewer": AgentDefinition(
                        description="Expert code reviewer for quality and security reviews.",
                        prompt="Analyze code quality and suggest improvements.",
                        tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
                    )
                }
            )
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Use the code-reviewer agent to review this codebase",
      options: {
        allowedTools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Task"],
        agents: {
          "code-reviewer": {
            description: "Expert code reviewer for quality and security reviews.",
            prompt: "Analyze code quality and suggest improvements.",
            tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
          }
        }
      }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Messages from within a subagent's context include a `parent_tool_use_id` field, letting you track which messages belong to which subagent execution.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MCP">
    Connect to external systems via the Model Context Protocol: databases, browsers, APIs, and [hundreds more](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

    This example connects the [Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) to give your agent browser automation capabilities:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(

            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                mcp_servers={
                    "playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}
                }

    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [Learn more about MCP →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/mcp)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Permissions">
    Control exactly which tools your agent can use. Allow safe operations, block dangerous ones, or require approval for sensitive actions.

    <Note>
    For interactive approval prompts and the `AskUserQuestion` tool, see [Handle approvals and user input](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input).
    </Note>

    This example creates a read-only agent that can analyze but not modify code:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(

        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript

    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [Learn more about permissions →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sessions">
    Maintain context across multiple exchanges. Claude remembers files read, analysis done, and conversation history. Resume sessions later, or fork them to explore different approaches.

    This example captures the session ID from the first query, then resumes to continue with full context:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        session_id = None

        # First query: capture the session ID

| [Plugins](/docs/en/agent-sdk/plugins) | Extend with custom commands, agents, and MCP servers | Programmatic via `plugins` option |

## Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools

The Claude platform offers multiple ways to build with Claude. Here's how the Agent SDK fits in:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Agent SDK vs Client SDK">
    The [Anthropic Client SDK](/docs/en/api/client-sdks) gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The **Agent SDK** gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.

    With the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Client SDK: You implement the tool loop
    response = client.messages.create(...)
    while response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        result = your_tool_executor(response.tool_use)
        response = client.messages.create(tool_result=result, ...)

    # Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously
    async for message in query(prompt="Fix the bug in auth.py"):
        print(message)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    // Client SDK: You implement the tool loop
    let response = await client.messages.create({...});
    while (response.stop_reason === "tool_use") {
      const result = yourToolExecutor(response.tool_use);
      response = await client.messages.create({ tool_result: result, ... });
    }

    // Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously
    for await (const message of query({ prompt: "Fix the bug in auth.py" })) {
      console.log(message);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI">
    Same capabilities, different interface:

    | Use case | Best choice |
    |----------|-------------|
    | Interactive development | CLI |
    | CI/CD pipelines | SDK |
    | Custom applications | SDK |
    | One-off tasks | CLI |
    | Production automation | SDK |

    Many teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production. Workflows translate directly between them.

# Quickstart

Get started with the Python or TypeScript Agent SDK to build AI agents that work autonomously

---

Use the Agent SDK to build an AI agent that reads your code, finds bugs, and fixes them, all without manual intervention.

**What you'll do:**
1. Set up a project with the Agent SDK
2. Create a file with some buggy code
3. Run an agent that finds and fixes the bugs automatically

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** or **Python 3.10+**
- An **Anthropic account** ([sign up here](https://platform.claude.com/))

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project folder">
    Create a new directory for this quickstart:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
    ```

    For your own projects, you can run the SDK from any folder; it will have access to files in that directory and its subdirectories by default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the Agent SDK package for your language:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="TypeScript">
        ```bash
        npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python (uv)">
        [uv Python package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package manager that handles virtual environments automatically:
        ```bash
        uv init && uv add claude-agent-sdk
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python (pip)">
        Create a virtual environment first, then install:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
        pip3 install claude-agent-sdk
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your API key">
    Get an API key from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/), then create a `.env` file in your project directory:

    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    The SDK also supports authentication via third-party API providers:

    - **Amazon Bedrock**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` environment variable and configure AWS credentials
    - **Google Vertex AI**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials
    - **Microsoft Azure**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1` environment variable and configure Azure credentials

    See the setup guides for [Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Azure AI Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/azure-ai-foundry) for details.

    <Note>
    Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a buggy file

This quickstart walks you through building an agent that can find and fix bugs in code. First, you need a file with some intentional bugs for the agent to fix. Create `utils.py` in the `my-agent` directory and paste the following code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

def get_user_name(user):
    return user["name"].upper()
```

This code has two bugs:
1. `calculate_average([])` crashes with division by zero
2. `get_user_name(None)` crashes with a TypeError

## Build an agent that finds and fixes bugs

Create `agent.py` if you're using the Python SDK, or `agent.ts` for TypeScript:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AssistantMessage, ResultMessage

async def main():
    # Agentic loop: streams messages as Claude works
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Review utils.py for bugs that would cause crashes. Fix any issues you find.",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],  # Tools Claude can use
            permission_mode="acceptEdits"            # Auto-approve file edits
        )
    ):
        # Print human-readable output
        if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
            for block in message.content:
                if hasattr(block, "text"):
                    print(block.text)              # Claude's reasoning
                elif hasattr(block, "name"):
                    print(f"Tool: {block.name}")   # Tool being called
        elif isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
            print(f"Done: {message.subtype}")      # Final result

asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// Agentic loop: streams messages as Claude works
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Review utils.py for bugs that would cause crashes. Fix any issues you find.",
  options: {
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],  // Tools Claude can use
    permissionMode: "acceptEdits"            // Auto-approve file edits
  }
})) {
  // Print human-readable output
  if (message.type === "assistant" && message.message?.content) {
    for (const block of message.message.content) {
      if ("text" in block) {
        console.log(block.text);             // Claude's reasoning
      } else if ("name" in block) {
        console.log(`Tool: ${block.name}`);  // Tool being called
      }
    }
  } else if (message.type === "result") {
    console.log(`Done: ${message.subtype}`); // Final result
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This code has three main parts:

1. **`query`**: the main entry point that creates the agentic loop. It returns an async iterator, so you use `async for` to stream messages as Claude works. See the full API in the [Python](/docs/en/agent-sdk/python#query) or [TypeScript](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#query) SDK reference.

2. **`prompt`**: what you want Claude to do. Claude figures out which tools to use based on the task.

3. **`options`**: configuration for the agent. This example uses `allowedTools` to restrict Claude to `Read`, `Edit`, and `Glob`, and `permissionMode: "acceptEdits"` to auto-approve file changes. Other options include `systemPrompt`, `mcpServers`, and more. See all options for [Python](/docs/en/agent-sdk/python#claudeagentoptions) or [TypeScript](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#claudeagentoptions).

The `async for` loop keeps running as Claude thinks, calls tools, observes results, and decides what to do next. Each iteration yields a message: Claude's reasoning, a tool call, a tool result, or the final outcome. The SDK handles the orchestration (tool execution, context management, retries) so you just consume the stream. The loop ends when Claude finishes the task or hits an error.

The message handling inside the loop filters for human-readable output. Without filtering, you'd see raw message objects including system initialization and internal state, which is useful for debugging but noisy otherwise.

<Note>
This example uses streaming to show progress in real-time. If you don't need live output (e.g., for background jobs or CI pipelines), you can collect all messages at once. See [Streaming vs. single-turn mode](/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode) for details.
</Note>

### Run your agent

Your agent is ready. Run it with the following command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    python3 agent.py
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    npx tsx agent.ts
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After running, check `utils.py`. You'll see defensive code handling empty lists and null users. Your agent autonomously:

1. **Read** `utils.py` to understand the code
2. **Analyzed** the logic and identified edge cases that would crash
3. **Edited** the file to add proper error handling

This is what makes the Agent SDK different: Claude executes tools directly instead of asking you to implement them.

<Note>
If you see "API key not found", make sure you've set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file or shell environment. See the [full troubleshooting guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting) for more help.
</Note>

### Try other prompts

Now that your agent is set up, try some different prompts:

- `"Add docstrings to all functions in utils.py"`
- `"Add type hints to all functions in utils.py"`
- `"Create a README.md documenting the functions in utils.py"`

### Customize your agent

You can modify your agent's behavior by changing the options. Here are a few examples:

**Add web search capability:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "WebSearch"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
options: {
  allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "WebSearch"],
  permissionMode: "acceptEdits"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Give Claude a custom system prompt:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
    system_prompt="You are a senior Python developer. Always follow PEP 8 style guidelines."
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
options: {
  allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],
  permissionMode: "acceptEdits",
  systemPrompt: "You are a senior Python developer. Always follow PEP 8 style guidelines."
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Run commands in the terminal:**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "Bash"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
options: {
  allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "Bash"],
  permissionMode: "acceptEdits"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

With `Bash` enabled, try: `"Write unit tests for utils.py, run them, and fix any failures"`

## Key concepts

**Tools** control what your agent can do:

| Tools | What the agent can do |
|-------|----------------------|
| `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Read-only analysis |
| `Read`, `Edit`, `Glob` | Analyze and modify code |
| `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Full automation |

**Permission modes** control how much human oversight you want:

| Mode | Behavior | Use case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-approves file edits, asks for other actions | Trusted development workflows |
| `bypassPermissions` | Runs without prompts | CI/CD pipelines, automation |
| `default` | Requires a `canUseTool` callback to handle approval | Custom approval flows |

The example above uses `acceptEdits` mode, which auto-approves file operations so the agent can run without interactive prompts. If you want to prompt users for approval, use `default` mode and provide a [`canUseTool` callback](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input) that collects user input. For more control, see [Permissions](/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions).

## Next steps

Now that you've created your first agent, learn how to extend its capabilities and tailor it to your use case:

- **[Permissions](/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions)**: control what your agent can do and when it needs approval
- **[Hooks](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks)**: run custom code before or after tool calls
- **[Sessions](/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions)**: build multi-turn agents that maintain context
- **[MCP servers](/docs/en/agent-sdk/mcp)**: connect to databases, browsers, APIs, and other external systems
- **[Hosting](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hosting)**: deploy agents to Docker, cloud, and CI/CD
- **[Example agents](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-demos)**: see complete examples: email assistant, research agent, and more

| `supportedModels()` | Returns available models with display info |
| `mcpServerStatus()` | Returns status of connected MCP servers |
| `accountInfo()` | Returns account information |

### `AgentDefinition`

Configuration for a subagent defined programmatically.

```typescript
type AgentDefinition = {
  description: string;
  tools?: string[];
  prompt: string;
  model?: 'sonnet' | 'opus' | 'haiku' | 'inherit';
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| `description` | Yes | Natural language description of when to use this agent |
| `tools` | No | Array of allowed tool names. If omitted, inherits all tools |
| `prompt` | Yes | The agent's system prompt |
| `model` | No | Model override for this agent. If omitted, uses the main model |

### `SettingSource`

Controls which filesystem-based configuration sources the SDK loads settings from.

```typescript
type SettingSource = 'user' | 'project' | 'local';
```

| Value | Description | Location |
|:------|:------------|:---------|
| `'user'` | Global user settings | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| `'project'` | Shared project settings (version controlled) | `.claude/settings.json` |
| `'local'` | Local project settings (gitignored) | `.claude/settings.local.json` |

#### Default behavior

When `settingSources` is **omitted** or **undefined**, the SDK does **not** load any filesystem settings. This provides isolation for SDK applications.

#### Why use settingSources?

**Load all filesystem settings (legacy behavior):**
```typescript
// Load all settings like SDK v0.0.x did
const result = query({
  prompt: "Analyze this code",
  options: {
    settingSources: ['user', 'project', 'local']  // Load all settings
  }
});
```

**Load only specific setting sources:**
```typescript
// Load only project settings, ignore user and local
const result = query({
  prompt: "Run CI checks",
  options: {
    settingSources: ['project']  // Only .claude/settings.json
  }
});
```

**Testing and CI environments:**
```typescript
// Ensure consistent behavior in CI by excluding local settings
const result = query({
  prompt: "Run tests",
  options: {
    settingSources: ['project'],  // Only team-shared settings
    permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions'
  }
});
```

**SDK-only applications:**
```typescript
// Define everything programmatically (default behavior)
// No filesystem dependencies - settingSources defaults to []
const result = query({
  prompt: "Review this PR",
  options: {
    // settingSources: [] is the default, no need to specify
    agents: { /* ... */ },
    mcpServers: { /* ... */ },
    allowedTools: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob']
  }
});
```

**Loading CLAUDE.md project instructions:**
```typescript
// Load project settings to include CLAUDE.md files
const result = query({
  prompt: "Add a new feature following project conventions",
  options: {
    systemPrompt: {
      type: 'preset',
      preset: 'claude_code'  // Required to use CLAUDE.md
    },
    settingSources: ['project'],  // Loads CLAUDE.md from project directory
    allowedTools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Edit']
  }
});
```

#### Settings precedence

When multiple sources are loaded, settings are merged with this precedence (highest to lowest):
1. Local settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
2. Project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
3. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

Programmatic options (like `agents`, `allowedTools`) always override filesystem settings.

### `PermissionMode`

```typescript
type PermissionMode =
  | 'default'           // Standard permission behavior
  | 'acceptEdits'       // Auto-accept file edits
  | 'bypassPermissions' // Bypass all permission checks
  | 'plan'              // Planning mode - no execution
```

### `CanUseTool`

```typescript
type CanUseTool = (
  toolName: string,
  input: ToolInput,
  options: {
    signal: AbortSignal;
    suggestions?: PermissionUpdate[];
  }
) => Promise<PermissionResult>;
```

### `PermissionResult`

Result of a permission check.

```typescript
type PermissionResult = 
  | {
      behavior: 'allow';
      updatedInput: ToolInput;
      updatedPermissions?: PermissionUpdate[];
    }
  | {

### `SdkPluginConfig`

Configuration for loading plugins in the SDK.

```typescript
type SdkPluginConfig = {
  type: 'local';
  path: string;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `type` | `'local'` | Must be `'local'` (only local plugins currently supported) |
| `path` | `string` | Absolute or relative path to the plugin directory |

  webSearchRequests: number;
  costUSD: number;
  contextWindow: number;
}
```

### `ConfigScope`

```

### `NonNullableUsage`

A version of [`Usage`](#usage) with all nullable fields made non-nullable.

```typescript
type NonNullableUsage = {
  [K in keyof Usage]: NonNullable<Usage[K]>;
}
```

### `Usage`

Token usage statistics (from `@anthropic-ai/sdk`).

```typescript
type Usage = {
  input_tokens: number | null;
  output_tokens: number | null;
  cache_creation_input_tokens?: number | null;
  cache_read_input_tokens?: number | null;
}
```

### `CallToolResult`

  isError?: boolean;
}
```

### `AbortError`

Custom error class for abort operations.

```typescript
class AbortError extends Error {}
```

## Sandbox Configuration

### `SandboxSettings`

Configuration for sandbox behavior. Use this to enable command sandboxing and configure network restrictions programmatically.

```typescript
type SandboxSettings = {
  enabled?: boolean;
  autoAllowBashIfSandboxed?: boolean;
  excludedCommands?: string[];
  allowUnsandboxedCommands?: boolean;
  network?: NetworkSandboxSettings;
  ignoreViolations?: SandboxIgnoreViolations;
  enableWeakerNestedSandbox?: boolean;
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable sandbox mode for command execution |
| `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | `boolean` | `false` | Auto-approve bash commands when sandbox is enabled |
| `excludedCommands` | `string[]` | `[]` | Commands that always bypass sandbox restrictions (e.g., `['docker']`). These run unsandboxed automatically without model involvement |
| `allowUnsandboxedCommands` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow the model to request running commands outside the sandbox. When `true`, the model can set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` in tool input, which falls back to the [permissions system](#permissions-fallback-for-unsandboxed-commands) |
| `network` | [`NetworkSandboxSettings`](#networksandboxsettings) | `undefined` | Network-specific sandbox configuration |
| `ignoreViolations` | [`SandboxIgnoreViolations`](#sandboxignoreviolations) | `undefined` | Configure which sandbox violations to ignore |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable a weaker nested sandbox for compatibility |

<Note>
**Filesystem and network access restrictions** are NOT configured via sandbox settings. Instead, they are derived from [permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings):

- **Filesystem read restrictions**: Read deny rules
- **Filesystem write restrictions**: Edit allow/deny rules
- **Network restrictions**: WebFetch allow/deny rules

Use sandbox settings for command execution sandboxing, and permission rules for filesystem and network access control.
</Note>

#### Example usage

```typescript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const result = await query({
  prompt: "Build and test my project",
  options: {
    sandbox: {
      enabled: true,
      autoAllowBashIfSandboxed: true,
      network: {
        allowLocalBinding: true
      }
    }
  }
});
```

<Warning>
**Unix socket security**: The `allowUnixSockets` option can grant access to powerful system services. For example, allowing `/var/run/docker.sock` effectively grants full host system access through the Docker API, bypassing sandbox isolation. Only allow Unix sockets that are strictly necessary and understand the security implications of each.
</Warning>

### `NetworkSandboxSettings`

Network-specific configuration for sandbox mode.

```typescript
type NetworkSandboxSettings = {
  allowLocalBinding?: boolean;
  allowUnixSockets?: string[];
  allowAllUnixSockets?: boolean;
  httpProxyPort?: number;
  socksProxyPort?: number;
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `allowLocalBinding` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow processes to bind to local ports (e.g., for dev servers) |
| `allowUnixSockets` | `string[]` | `[]` | Unix socket paths that processes can access (e.g., Docker socket) |
| `allowAllUnixSockets` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow access to all Unix sockets |
| `httpProxyPort` | `number` | `undefined` | HTTP proxy port for network requests |
| `socksProxyPort` | `number` | `undefined` | SOCKS proxy port for network requests |

### `SandboxIgnoreViolations`

Configuration for ignoring specific sandbox violations.

```typescript
type SandboxIgnoreViolations = {
  file?: string[];
  network?: string[];
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `file` | `string[]` | `[]` | File path patterns to ignore violations for |
| `network` | `string[]` | `[]` | Network patterns to ignore violations for |

### Permissions Fallback for Unsandboxed Commands

When `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is enabled, the model can request to run commands outside the sandbox by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in the tool input. These requests fall back to the existing permissions system, meaning your `canUseTool` handler will be invoked, allowing you to implement custom authorization logic.

<Note>
**`excludedCommands` vs `allowUnsandboxedCommands`:**
- `excludedCommands`: A static list of commands that always bypass the sandbox automatically (e.g., `['docker']`). The model has no control over this.
- `allowUnsandboxedCommands`: Lets the model decide at runtime whether to request unsandboxed execution by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in the tool input.
</Note>

```typescript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const result = await query({
  prompt: "Deploy my application",
  options: {
    sandbox: {
      enabled: true,
      allowUnsandboxedCommands: true  // Model can request unsandboxed execution
    },
    permissionMode: "default",
    canUseTool: async (tool, input) => {
      // Check if the model is requesting to bypass the sandbox
      if (tool === "Bash" && input.dangerouslyDisableSandbox) {
        // The model wants to run this command outside the sandbox
        console.log(`Unsandboxed command requested: ${input.command}`);

        // Return true to allow, false to deny
        return isCommandAuthorized(input.command);
      }
      return true;
    }
  }
});
```

This pattern enables you to:

- **Audit model requests**: Log when the model requests unsandboxed execution
- **Implement allowlists**: Only permit specific commands to run unsandboxed
- **Add approval workflows**: Require explicit authorization for privileged operations

<Warning>
Commands running with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` have full system access. Ensure your `canUseTool` handler validates these requests carefully.

If `permissionMode` is set to `bypassPermissions` and `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is enabled, the model can autonomously execute commands outside the sandbox without any approval prompts. This combination effectively allows the model to escape sandbox isolation silently.
</Warning>

# TypeScript SDK V2 interface (preview)

Preview of the simplified V2 TypeScript Agent SDK, with session-based send/stream patterns for multi-turn conversations.

---

<Warning>
The V2 interface is an **unstable preview**. APIs may change based on feedback before becoming stable. Some features like session forking are only available in the [V1 SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript).
</Warning>

The V2 Claude Agent TypeScript SDK removes the need for async generators and yield coordination. This makes multi-turn conversations simpler, instead of managing generator state across turns, each turn is a separate `send()`/`stream()` cycle. The API surface reduces to three concepts:

- `createSession()` / `resumeSession()`: Start or continue a conversation
- `session.send()`: Send a message
- `session.stream()`: Get the response

## Installation

The V2 interface is included in the existing SDK package:

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

## Quick start

### One-shot prompt

For simple single-turn queries where you don't need to maintain a session, use `unstable_v2_prompt()`. This example sends a math question and logs the answer:

```typescript
import { unstable_v2_prompt } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

const result = await unstable_v2_prompt('What is 2 + 2?', {
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6'
})
console.log(result.result)
```

<details>
<summary>See the same operation in V1</summary>

```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

const q = query({
  prompt: 'What is 2 + 2?',
  options: { model: 'claude-opus-4-6' }
})

for await (const msg of q) {
  if (msg.type === 'result') {
    console.log(msg.result)
  }
}
```

</details>

### Basic session

For interactions beyond a single prompt, create a session. V2 separates sending and streaming into distinct steps:
- `send()` dispatches your message
- `stream()` streams back the response

This explicit separation makes it easier to add logic between turns (like processing responses before sending follow-ups).

The example below creates a session, sends "Hello!" to Claude, and prints the text response. It uses [`await using`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-2.html#using-declarations-and-explicit-resource-management) (TypeScript 5.2+) to automatically close the session when the block exits. You can also call `session.close()` manually.

```typescript
import { unstable_v2_createSession } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

await using session = unstable_v2_createSession({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6'
})

await session.send('Hello!')
for await (const msg of session.stream()) {
  // Filter for assistant messages to get human-readable output
  if (msg.type === 'assistant') {
    const text = msg.message.content
      .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
      .map(block => block.text)
      .join('')
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>See the same operation in V1</summary>

In V1, both input and output flow through a single async generator. For a basic prompt this looks similar, but adding multi-turn logic requires restructuring to use an input generator.

```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

const q = query({
  prompt: 'Hello!',
  options: { model: 'claude-opus-4-6' }
})

for await (const msg of q) {
  if (msg.type === 'assistant') {
    const text = msg.message.content
      .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
      .map(block => block.text)
      .join('')
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

</details>

### Multi-turn conversation

Sessions persist context across multiple exchanges. To continue a conversation, call `send()` again on the same session. Claude remembers the previous turns.

This example asks a math question, then asks a follow-up that references the previous answer:

```typescript
import { unstable_v2_createSession } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

await using session = unstable_v2_createSession({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6'
})

// Turn 1
await session.send('What is 5 + 3?')
for await (const msg of session.stream()) {
  // Filter for assistant messages to get human-readable output
  if (msg.type === 'assistant') {
    const text = msg.message.content
      .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
      .map(block => block.text)
      .join('')
    console.log(text)
  }
}

// Turn 2
await session.send('Multiply that by 2')
for await (const msg of session.stream()) {
  if (msg.type === 'assistant') {
    const text = msg.message.content
      .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
      .map(block => block.text)
      .join('')
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>See the same operation in V1</summary>

```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

// Must create an async iterable to feed messages
async function* createInputStream() {
  yield {
    type: 'user',
    session_id: '',
    message: { role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'What is 5 + 3?' }] },
    parent_tool_use_id: null
  }
  // Must coordinate when to yield next message
  yield {
    type: 'user',
    session_id: '',
    message: { role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Multiply by 2' }] },
    parent_tool_use_id: null
  }
}

const q = query({
  prompt: createInputStream(),
  options: { model: 'claude-opus-4-6' }
})

for await (const msg of q) {
  if (msg.type === 'assistant') {
    const text = msg.message.content
      .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
      .map(block => block.text)
      .join('')
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```

</details>

### Session resume

If you have a session ID from a previous interaction, you can resume it later. This is useful for long-running workflows or when you need to persist conversations across application restarts.

This example creates a session, stores its ID, closes it, then resumes the conversation:

```typescript
import {
  unstable_v2_createSession,
  unstable_v2_resumeSession,
  type SDKMessage
} from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

// Helper to extract text from assistant messages
function getAssistantText(msg: SDKMessage): string | null {
  if (msg.type !== 'assistant') return null
  return msg.message.content
    .filter(block => block.type === 'text')
    .map(block => block.text)
    .join('')
}

### Cleanup

Sessions can be closed manually or automatically using [`await using`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-2.html#using-declarations-and-explicit-resource-management), a TypeScript 5.2+ feature for automatic resource cleanup. If you're using an older TypeScript version or encounter compatibility issues, use manual cleanup instead.

**Automatic cleanup (TypeScript 5.2+):**

```typescript
import { unstable_v2_createSession } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

await using session = unstable_v2_createSession({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6'
})
// Session closes automatically when the block exits
```

**Manual cleanup:**

```typescript
import { unstable_v2_createSession } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

const session = unstable_v2_createSession({
  model: 'claude-opus-4-6'
})
// ... use the session ...
session.close()
```

## API reference

### `unstable_v2_createSession()`

Creates a new session for multi-turn conversations.

```typescript
function unstable_v2_createSession(options: {
  model: string;
  // Additional options supported
}): Session
```

### `unstable_v2_resumeSession()`

Resumes an existing session by ID.

```typescript
function unstable_v2_resumeSession(
  sessionId: string,
  options: {
    model: string;
    // Additional options supported
  }
): Session
```

### `unstable_v2_prompt()`

One-shot convenience function for single-turn queries.

```typescript
function unstable_v2_prompt(
  prompt: string,
  options: {
    model: string;
    // Additional options supported
  }
): Promise<Result>
```

### Session interface

```typescript
interface Session {
  send(message: string): Promise<void>;
  stream(): AsyncGenerator<SDKMessage>;
  close(): void;
}
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install claude-agent-sdk
```

## Choosing Between `query()` and `ClaudeSDKClient`

The Python SDK provides two ways to interact with Claude Code:

### Quick Comparison

| Feature             | `query()`                     | `ClaudeSDKClient`                  |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Session**         | Creates new session each time | Reuses same session                |
| **Conversation**    | Single exchange               | Multiple exchanges in same context |
| **Connection**      | Managed automatically         | Manual control                     |
| **Streaming Input** | ✅ Supported                  | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Interrupts**      | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Hooks**           | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Custom Tools**    | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Continue Chat**   | ❌ New session each time      | ✅ Maintains conversation          |
| **Use Case**        | One-off tasks                 | Continuous conversations           |

### When to Use `query()` (New Session Each Time)

**Best for:**

- One-off questions where you don't need conversation history
- Independent tasks that don't require context from previous exchanges
- Simple automation scripts
- When you want a fresh start each time

### When to Use `ClaudeSDKClient` (Continuous Conversation)

**Best for:**

- **Continuing conversations** - When you need Claude to remember context
- **Follow-up questions** - Building on previous responses
- **Interactive applications** - Chat interfaces, REPLs
- **Response-driven logic** - When next action depends on Claude's response
- **Session control** - Managing conversation lifecycle explicitly

## Functions

### `query()`

Creates a new session for each interaction with Claude Code. Returns an async iterator that yields messages as they arrive. Each call to `query()` starts fresh with no memory of previous interactions.

```python
async def query(
    *,
    prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict[str, Any]],
    options: ClaudeAgentOptions | None = None
) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type                         | Description                                                                |
| :-------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt`  | `str \| AsyncIterable[dict]` | The input prompt as a string or async iterable for streaming mode          |
| `options` | `ClaudeAgentOptions \| None` | Optional configuration object (defaults to `ClaudeAgentOptions()` if None) |

#### Returns

Returns an `AsyncIterator[Message]` that yields messages from the conversation.

#### Example - With options

```python

import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="You are an expert Python developer",
        permission_mode='acceptEdits',
        cwd="/home/user/project"
    )

    async for message in query(
        prompt="Create a Python web server",
        options=options
    ):
        print(message)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### `tool()`

Decorator for defining MCP tools with type safety.

```python
def tool(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    input_schema: type | dict[str, Any]
) -> Callable[[Callable[[Any], Awaitable[dict[str, Any]]]], SdkMcpTool[Any]]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Type                     | Description                                             |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`         | `str`                    | Unique identifier for the tool                          |
| `description`  | `str`                    | Human-readable description of what the tool does        |
| `input_schema` | `type \| dict[str, Any]` | Schema defining the tool's input parameters (see below) |

#### Input Schema Options

1. **Simple type mapping** (recommended):

   ```python
   {"text": str, "count": int, "enabled": bool}
   ```

2. **JSON Schema format** (for complex validation):
   ```python
   {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
           "text": {"type": "string"},
           "count": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}
       },
       "required": ["text"]
   }
   ```

#### Returns

A decorator function that wraps the tool implementation and returns an `SdkMcpTool` instance.

#### Example

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import tool
from typing import Any

@tool("greet", "Greet a user", {"name": str})
async def greet(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Hello, {args['name']}!"
        }]
    }
```

### `create_sdk_mcp_server()`

Create an in-process MCP server that runs within your Python application.

```python
def create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name: str,
    version: str = "1.0.0",
    tools: list[SdkMcpTool[Any]] | None = None
) -> McpSdkServerConfig
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type                            | Default   | Description                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | `str`                           | -         | Unique identifier for the server                      |
| `version` | `str`                           | `"1.0.0"` | Server version string                                 |
| `tools`   | `list[SdkMcpTool[Any]] \| None` | `None`    | List of tool functions created with `@tool` decorator |

#### Returns

Returns an `McpSdkServerConfig` object that can be passed to `ClaudeAgentOptions.mcp_servers`.

#### Example

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import tool, create_sdk_mcp_server

@tool("add", "Add two numbers", {"a": float, "b": float})
async def add(args):
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Sum: {args['a'] + args['b']}"
        }]
    }

@tool("multiply", "Multiply two numbers", {"a": float, "b": float})
async def multiply(args):
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Product: {args['a'] * args['b']}"
        }]
    }

calculator = create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name="calculator",
    version="2.0.0",
    tools=[add, multiply]  # Pass decorated functions
)

# Use with Claude
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={"calc": calculator},
    allowed_tools=["mcp__calc__add", "mcp__calc__multiply"]
)
```

## Classes

### `ClaudeSDKClient`

**Maintains a conversation session across multiple exchanges.** This is the Python equivalent of how the TypeScript SDK's `query()` function works internally - it creates a client object that can continue conversations.

#### Key Features

- **Session Continuity**: Maintains conversation context across multiple `query()` calls
- **Same Conversation**: Claude remembers previous messages in the session
- **Interrupt Support**: Can stop Claude mid-execution
- **Explicit Lifecycle**: You control when the session starts and ends
- **Response-driven Flow**: Can react to responses and send follow-ups
- **Custom Tools & Hooks**: Supports custom tools (created with `@tool` decorator) and hooks

```python
class ClaudeSDKClient:
    def __init__(self, options: ClaudeAgentOptions | None = None)
    async def connect(self, prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict] | None = None) -> None
    async def query(self, prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict], session_id: str = "default") -> None
    async def receive_messages(self) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
    async def receive_response(self) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
    async def interrupt(self) -> None
    async def rewind_files(self, user_message_uuid: str) -> None
    async def disconnect(self) -> None
```

#### Methods

| Method                      | Description                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `__init__(options)`         | Initialize the client with optional configuration                   |
| `connect(prompt)`           | Connect to Claude with an optional initial prompt or message stream |
| `query(prompt, session_id)` | Send a new request in streaming mode                                |
| `receive_messages()`        | Receive all messages from Claude as an async iterator               |
| `receive_response()`        | Receive messages until and including a ResultMessage                |
| `interrupt()`               | Send interrupt signal (only works in streaming mode)                |
| `rewind_files(user_message_uuid)` | Restore files to their state at the specified user message. Requires `enable_file_checkpointing=True`. See [File checkpointing](/docs/en/agent-sdk/file-checkpointing) |
| `disconnect()`              | Disconnect from Claude                                              |

#### Context Manager Support

The client can be used as an async context manager for automatic connection management:

```python
async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
    await client.query("Hello Claude")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

> **Important:** When iterating over messages, avoid using `break` to exit early as this can cause asyncio cleanup issues. Instead, let the iteration complete naturally or use flags to track when you've found what you need.

#### Example - Continuing a conversation

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, AssistantMessage, TextBlock, ResultMessage

async def main():
    async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
        # First question
        await client.query("What's the capital of France?")

        # Process response
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

        # Follow-up question - Claude remembers the previous context
        await client.query("What's the population of that city?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

        # Another follow-up - still in the same conversation
        await client.query("What are some famous landmarks there?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example - Streaming input with ClaudeSDKClient

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient

async def message_stream():
    """Generate messages dynamically."""
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze the following data:"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Temperature: 25°C"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Humidity: 60%"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "What patterns do you see?"}

async def main():
    async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
        # Stream input to Claude
        await client.query(message_stream())

        # Process response
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)

        # Follow-up in same session
        await client.query("Should we be concerned about these readings?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example - Using interrupts

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def interruptible_task():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        allowed_tools=["Bash"],
        permission_mode="acceptEdits"
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        # Start a long-running task
        await client.query("Count from 1 to 100 slowly")

        # Let it run for a bit
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

        # Interrupt the task
        await client.interrupt()
        print("Task interrupted!")

        # Send a new command
        await client.query("Just say hello instead")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Process the new response
            pass

asyncio.run(interruptible_task())
```

#### Example - Advanced permission control

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ClaudeAgentOptions
)
from claude_agent_sdk.types import PermissionResultAllow, PermissionResultDeny

async def custom_permission_handler(
    tool_name: str,
    input_data: dict,
    context: dict
) -> PermissionResultAllow | PermissionResultDeny:
    """Custom logic for tool permissions."""

    # Block writes to system directories
    if tool_name == "Write" and input_data.get("file_path", "").startswith("/system/"):
        return PermissionResultDeny(
            message="System directory write not allowed",
            interrupt=True
        )

    # Redirect sensitive file operations
    if tool_name in ["Write", "Edit"] and "config" in input_data.get("file_path", ""):
        safe_path = f"./sandbox/{input_data['file_path']}"
        return PermissionResultAllow(
            updated_input={**input_data, "file_path": safe_path}
        )

    # Allow everything else
    return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)

async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        can_use_tool=custom_permission_handler,
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Edit"]
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query("Update the system config file")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Will use sandbox path instead
            print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

| Value       | Description                                  | Location                      |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `"user"`    | Global user settings                         | `~/.claude/settings.json`     |
| `"project"` | Shared project settings (version controlled) | `.claude/settings.json`       |
| `"local"`   | Local project settings (gitignored)          | `.claude/settings.local.json` |

#### Default behavior

When `setting_sources` is **omitted** or **`None`**, the SDK does **not** load any filesystem settings. This provides isolation for SDK applications.

#### Why use setting_sources?

**Load all filesystem settings (legacy behavior):**

```python
# Load all settings like SDK v0.0.x did
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async for message in query(
    prompt="Analyze this code",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["user", "project", "local"]  # Load all settings
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Load only specific setting sources:**

```python
# Load only project settings, ignore user and local
async for message in query(
    prompt="Run CI checks",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["project"]  # Only .claude/settings.json
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Testing and CI environments:**

```python
# Ensure consistent behavior in CI by excluding local settings
async for message in query(
    prompt="Run tests",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["project"],  # Only team-shared settings
        permission_mode="bypassPermissions"
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**SDK-only applications:**

```python
# Define everything programmatically (default behavior)
# No filesystem dependencies - setting_sources defaults to None
async for message in query(
    prompt="Review this PR",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        # setting_sources=None is the default, no need to specify
        agents={ /* ... */ },
        mcp_servers={ /* ... */ },
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Loading CLAUDE.md project instructions:**

```python
# Load project settings to include CLAUDE.md files
async for message in query(
    prompt="Add a new feature following project conventions",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt={
            "type": "preset",
            "preset": "claude_code"  # Use Claude Code's system prompt
        },
        setting_sources=["project"],  # Required to load CLAUDE.md from project
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Edit"]
    )
):
    print(message)
```

#### Settings precedence

When multiple sources are loaded, settings are merged with this precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Local settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
2. Project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
3. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

Programmatic options (like `agents`, `allowed_tools`) always override filesystem settings.

### `AgentDefinition`

| `tools`       | No       | Array of allowed tool names. If omitted, inherits all tools    |
| `prompt`      | Yes      | The agent's system prompt                                      |
| `model`       | No       | Model override for this agent. If omitted, uses the main model |

### `PermissionMode`

Permission modes for controlling tool execution.

```python
PermissionMode = Literal[
    "default",           # Standard permission behavior
    "acceptEdits",       # Auto-accept file edits

```python
CanUseTool = Callable[
    [str, dict[str, Any], ToolPermissionContext],

### Hook Usage Example

This example registers two hooks: one that blocks dangerous bash commands like `rm -rf /`, and another that logs all tool usage for auditing. The security hook only runs on Bash commands (via the `matcher`), while the logging hook runs on all tools.

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher, HookContext
from typing import Any

async def validate_bash_command(
    input_data: dict[str, Any],
    tool_use_id: str | None,
    context: HookContext
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate and potentially block dangerous bash commands."""
    if input_data['tool_name'] == 'Bash':
        command = input_data['tool_input'].get('command', '')
        if 'rm -rf /' in command:
            return {
                'hookSpecificOutput': {
                    'hookEventName': 'PreToolUse',
                    'permissionDecision': 'deny',
                    'permissionDecisionReason': 'Dangerous command blocked'
                }
            }
    return {}

async def log_tool_use(
    input_data: dict[str, Any],
    tool_use_id: str | None,
    context: HookContext
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Log all tool usage for auditing."""
    print(f"Tool used: {input_data.get('tool_name')}")
    return {}

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={
        'PreToolUse': [
            HookMatcher(matcher='Bash', hooks=[validate_bash_command], timeout=120),  # 2 min for validation
            HookMatcher(hooks=[log_tool_use])  # Applies to all tools (default 60s timeout)
        ],
        'PostToolUse': [
            HookMatcher(hooks=[log_tool_use])
        ]
    }
)

async for message in query(
    prompt="Analyze this codebase",
    options=options
):
    print(message)
```

## Tool Input/Output Types

Documentation of input/output schemas for all built-in Claude Code tools. While the Python SDK doesn't export these as types, they represent the structure of tool inputs and outputs in messages.

### Task

**Tool name:** `Task`

**Input:**

```python
{
    "description": str,      # A short (3-5 word) description of the task

    "subagent_type": str     # The type of specialized agent to use
}
```

**Output:**

```python
{
    "result": str,                    # Final result from the subagent

        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Current time: {current_time}"
        }]
    }

async def main():
    # Create SDK MCP server with custom tools
    my_server = create_sdk_mcp_server(
        name="utilities",
        version="1.0.0",
        tools=[calculate, get_time]
    )

    # Configure options with the server
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        mcp_servers={"utils": my_server},
        allowed_tools=[
            "mcp__utils__calculate",
            "mcp__utils__get_time"
        ]
    )

    # Use ClaudeSDKClient for interactive tool usage
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query("What's 123 * 456?")

        # Process calculation response
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Calculation: {block.text}")

        # Follow up with time query
        await client.query("What time is it now?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Time: {block.text}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Sandbox Configuration

### `SandboxSettings`

Configuration for sandbox behavior. Use this to enable command sandboxing and configure network restrictions programmatically.

```python
class SandboxSettings(TypedDict, total=False):
    enabled: bool
    autoAllowBashIfSandboxed: bool
    excludedCommands: list[str]
    allowUnsandboxedCommands: bool
    network: SandboxNetworkConfig
    ignoreViolations: SandboxIgnoreViolations
    enableWeakerNestedSandbox: bool
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `False` | Enable sandbox mode for command execution |
| `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | `bool` | `False` | Auto-approve bash commands when sandbox is enabled |
| `excludedCommands` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Commands that always bypass sandbox restrictions (e.g., `["docker"]`). These run unsandboxed automatically without model involvement |
| `allowUnsandboxedCommands` | `bool` | `False` | Allow the model to request running commands outside the sandbox. When `True`, the model can set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` in tool input, which falls back to the [permissions system](#permissions-fallback-for-unsandboxed-commands) |
| `network` | [`SandboxNetworkConfig`](#sandboxnetworkconfig) | `None` | Network-specific sandbox configuration |
| `ignoreViolations` | [`SandboxIgnoreViolations`](#sandboxignoreviolations) | `None` | Configure which sandbox violations to ignore |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | `bool` | `False` | Enable a weaker nested sandbox for compatibility |

<Note>
**Filesystem and network access restrictions** are NOT configured via sandbox settings. Instead, they are derived from [permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings):

- **Filesystem read restrictions**: Read deny rules
- **Filesystem write restrictions**: Edit allow/deny rules
- **Network restrictions**: WebFetch allow/deny rules

Use sandbox settings for command execution sandboxing, and permission rules for filesystem and network access control.
</Note>

#### Example usage

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, SandboxSettings

sandbox_settings: SandboxSettings = {
    "enabled": True,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": True,
    "network": {
        "allowLocalBinding": True
    }
}

async for message in query(
    prompt="Build and test my project",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(sandbox=sandbox_settings)
):
    print(message)
```

<Warning>
**Unix socket security**: The `allowUnixSockets` option can grant access to powerful system services. For example, allowing `/var/run/docker.sock` effectively grants full host system access through the Docker API, bypassing sandbox isolation. Only allow Unix sockets that are strictly necessary and understand the security implications of each.
</Warning>

### `SandboxNetworkConfig`

Network-specific configuration for sandbox mode.

```python
class SandboxNetworkConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    allowLocalBinding: bool
    allowUnixSockets: list[str]
    allowAllUnixSockets: bool
    httpProxyPort: int
    socksProxyPort: int
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `allowLocalBinding` | `bool` | `False` | Allow processes to bind to local ports (e.g., for dev servers) |
| `allowUnixSockets` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Unix socket paths that processes can access (e.g., Docker socket) |
| `allowAllUnixSockets` | `bool` | `False` | Allow access to all Unix sockets |
| `httpProxyPort` | `int` | `None` | HTTP proxy port for network requests |
| `socksProxyPort` | `int` | `None` | SOCKS proxy port for network requests |

### `SandboxIgnoreViolations`

Configuration for ignoring specific sandbox violations.

```python
class SandboxIgnoreViolations(TypedDict, total=False):
    file: list[str]
    network: list[str]
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `file` | `list[str]` | `[]` | File path patterns to ignore violations for |
| `network` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Network patterns to ignore violations for |

### Permissions Fallback for Unsandboxed Commands

When `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is enabled, the model can request to run commands outside the sandbox by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` in the tool input. These requests fall back to the existing permissions system, meaning your `can_use_tool` handler will be invoked, allowing you to implement custom authorization logic.

<Note>
**`excludedCommands` vs `allowUnsandboxedCommands`:**
- `excludedCommands`: A static list of commands that always bypass the sandbox automatically (e.g., `["docker"]`). The model has no control over this.
- `allowUnsandboxedCommands`: Lets the model decide at runtime whether to request unsandboxed execution by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` in the tool input.
</Note>

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def can_use_tool(tool: str, input: dict) -> bool:
    # Check if the model is requesting to bypass the sandbox
    if tool == "Bash" and input.get("dangerouslyDisableSandbox"):
        # The model wants to run this command outside the sandbox
        print(f"Unsandboxed command requested: {input.get('command')}")

        # Return True to allow, False to deny
        return is_command_authorized(input.get("command"))
    return True

async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Deploy my application",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            sandbox={
                "enabled": True,
                "allowUnsandboxedCommands": True  # Model can request unsandboxed execution
            },
            permission_mode="default",
            can_use_tool=can_use_tool
        )
    ):
        print(message)
```

This pattern enables you to:

- **Audit model requests**: Log when the model requests unsandboxed execution
- **Implement allowlists**: Only permit specific commands to run unsandboxed
- **Add approval workflows**: Require explicit authorization for privileged operations

<Warning>
Commands running with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` have full system access. Ensure your `can_use_tool` handler validates these requests carefully.

If `permission_mode` is set to `bypassPermissions` and `allow_unsandboxed_commands` is enabled, the model can autonomously execute commands outside the sandbox without any approval prompts. This combination effectively allows the model to escape sandbox isolation silently.
</Warning>

# Migrate to Claude Agent SDK

Guide for migrating the Claude Code TypeScript and Python SDKs to the Claude Agent SDK

---

## Overview

The Claude Code SDK has been renamed to the **Claude Agent SDK** and its documentation has been reorganized. This change reflects the SDK's broader capabilities for building AI agents beyond just coding tasks.

## What's Changed

| Aspect                   | Old                         | New                              |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Package Name (TS/JS)** | `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` |
| **Python Package**       | `claude-code-sdk`           | `claude-agent-sdk`               |
| **Documentation Location** | Claude Code docs | API Guide → Agent SDK section |

<Note>
**Documentation Changes:** The Agent SDK documentation has moved from the Claude Code docs to the API Guide under a dedicated [Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) section. The Claude Code docs now focus on the CLI tool and automation features.
</Note>

## Migration Steps

### For TypeScript/JavaScript Projects

**1. Uninstall the old package:**

```bash
npm uninstall @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**2. Install the new package:**

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

**3. Update your imports:**

Change all imports from `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`:

```typescript
// Before
import { query, tool, createSdkMcpServer } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-code";

// After
import {
  query,
  tool,
  createSdkMcpServer,
} from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
```

**4. Update package.json dependencies:**

If you have the package listed in your `package.json`, update it:

```json
// Before
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@anthropic-ai/claude-code": "^1.0.0"
  }
}

// After
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

That's it! No other code changes are required.

### For Python Projects

**1. Uninstall the old package:**

```bash
pip uninstall claude-code-sdk
```

**2. Install the new package:**

```bash
pip install claude-agent-sdk
```

**3. Update your imports:**

Change all imports from `claude_code_sdk` to `claude_agent_sdk`:

```python
# Before
from claude_code_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions

# After
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions
```

**4. Update type names:**

Change `ClaudeCodeOptions` to `ClaudeAgentOptions`:

```python
# Before
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions

options = ClaudeCodeOptions(
    model="claude-opus-4-6"
)

# After
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model="claude-opus-4-6"
)
```

**5. Review [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)**

Make any code changes needed to complete the migration.

## Breaking changes

<Warning>
To improve isolation and explicit configuration, Claude Agent SDK v0.1.0 introduces breaking changes for users migrating from Claude Code SDK. Review this section carefully before migrating.
</Warning>

### Python: ClaudeCodeOptions renamed to ClaudeAgentOptions

**What changed:** The Python SDK type `ClaudeCodeOptions` has been renamed to `ClaudeAgentOptions`.

**Migration:**

```python
# BEFORE (v0.0.x)
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions

options = ClaudeCodeOptions(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)

# AFTER (v0.1.0)
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)
```

**Why this changed:** The type name now matches the "Claude Agent SDK" branding and provides consistency across the SDK's naming conventions.

### System prompt no longer default

**What changed:** The SDK no longer uses Claude Code's system prompt by default.

**Migration:**

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
// BEFORE (v0.0.x) - Used Claude Code's system prompt by default
const result = query({ prompt: "Hello" });

// AFTER (v0.1.0) - Uses minimal system prompt by default
// To get the old behavior, explicitly request Claude Code's preset:
const result = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    systemPrompt: { type: "preset", preset: "claude_code" }
  }
});

// Or use a custom system prompt:
const result = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful coding assistant"
  }
});
```

```python Python
# BEFORE (v0.0.x) - Used Claude Code's system prompt by default
async for message in query(prompt="Hello"):
    print(message)

# AFTER (v0.1.0) - Uses minimal system prompt by default
# To get the old behavior, explicitly request Claude Code's preset:
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async for message in query(
    prompt="Hello",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt={"type": "preset", "preset": "claude_code"}  # Use the preset
    )
):
    print(message)

# Or use a custom system prompt:
async for message in query(
    prompt="Hello",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="You are a helpful coding assistant"
    )
):
    print(message)
```

</CodeGroup>

**Why this changed:** Provides better control and isolation for SDK applications. You can now build agents with custom behavior without inheriting Claude Code's CLI-focused instructions.

### Settings Sources No Longer Loaded by Default

**What changed:** The SDK no longer reads from filesystem settings (CLAUDE.md, settings.json, slash commands, etc.) by default.

**Migration:**

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
// BEFORE (v0.0.x) - Loaded all settings automatically
const result = query({ prompt: "Hello" });
// Would read from:
// - ~/.claude/settings.json (user)
// - .claude/settings.json (project)
// - .claude/settings.local.json (local)
// - CLAUDE.md files
// - Custom slash commands

// AFTER (v0.1.0) - No settings loaded by default
// To get the old behavior:
const result = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    settingSources: ["user", "project", "local"]
  }
});

// Or load only specific sources:
const result = query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    settingSources: ["project"]  // Only project settings
  }
});
```

```python Python
# BEFORE (v0.0.x) - Loaded all settings automatically
async for message in query(prompt="Hello"):
    print(message)
# Would read from:
# - ~/.claude/settings.json (user)
# - .claude/settings.json (project)
# - .claude/settings.local.json (local)
# - CLAUDE.md files
# - Custom slash commands

# AFTER (v0.1.0) - No settings loaded by default
# To get the old behavior:
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async for message in query(
    prompt="Hello",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["user", "project", "local"]
    )
):
    print(message)

# Or load only specific sources:
async for message in query(
    prompt="Hello",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["project"]  # Only project settings
    )
):
    print(message)
```

</CodeGroup>

**Why this changed:** Ensures SDK applications have predictable behavior independent of local filesystem configurations. This is especially important for:
- **CI/CD environments** - Consistent behavior without local customizations
- **Deployed applications** - No dependency on filesystem settings
- **Testing** - Isolated test environments
- **Multi-tenant systems** - Prevent settings leakage between users

<Note>
**Backward compatibility:** If your application relied on filesystem settings (custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md instructions, etc.), add `settingSources: ['user', 'project', 'local']` to your options.
</Note>

## Why the Rename?

The Claude Code SDK was originally designed for coding tasks, but it has evolved into a powerful framework for building all types of AI agents. The new name "Claude Agent SDK" better reflects its capabilities:

- Building business agents (legal assistants, finance advisors, customer support)
- Creating specialized coding agents (SRE bots, security reviewers, code review agents)
- Developing custom agents for any domain with tool use, MCP integration, and more

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during migration:

**For TypeScript/JavaScript:**

1. Check that all imports are updated to use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
2. Verify your package.json has the new package name
3. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are updated

**For Python:**

1. Check that all imports are updated to use `claude_agent_sdk`
2. Verify your requirements.txt or pyproject.toml has the new package name
3. Run `pip install claude-agent-sdk` to ensure the package is installed
