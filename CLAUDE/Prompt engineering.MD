<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

## Before prompt engineering

This guide assumes that you have:
1. A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case
2. Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
3. A first draft prompt you want to improve

If not, we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first. Check out [Define your success criteria](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/define-success) and [Create strong empirical evaluations](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) for tips and guidance.

## When to prompt engineer

  This guide focuses on success criteria that are controllable through prompt engineering.
  Not every success criteria or failing eval is best solved by prompt engineering. For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.

<section title="Prompting vs. finetuning">

  Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:<br/>
  - **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.
  - **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.
  - **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.
  - **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.
  - **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.
  - **Flexibility & rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.
  - **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.
  - **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents
  - **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model's broad capabilities.
  - **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.

<Note>
Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Note>

Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we've created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.

The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the "blank page problem" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

<Tip>Try the prompt generator now directly on the [Console](/dashboard).</Tip>

If you're interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our [prompt generator Google Colab notebook](https://anthropic.com/metaprompt-notebook/). There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.

<Note>Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an [API key](/settings/keys).</Note>

# Use prompt templates and variables

---

When deploying an LLM-based application with Claude, your API calls will typically consist of two types of content:
- **Fixed content:** Static instructions or context that remain constant across multiple interactions
- **Variable content:** Dynamic elements that change with each request or conversation, such as:
    - User inputs
    - Retrieved content for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Conversation context such as user account history
    - System-generated data such as tool use results fed in from other independent calls to Claude

A **prompt template** combines these fixed and variable parts, using placeholders for the dynamic content. In the [Claude Console](/), these placeholders are denoted with **\{\{double brackets\}\}**, making them easily identifiable and allowing for quick testing of different values.

---

# When to use prompt templates and variables
You should always use prompt templates and variables when you expect any part of your prompt to be repeated in another call to Claude (only via the API or the [Claude Console](/). [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) currently does not support prompt templates or variables).

Prompt templates offer several benefits:
- **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent structure for your prompts across multiple interactions
- **Efficiency:** Easily swap out variable content without rewriting the entire prompt
- **Testability:** Quickly test different inputs and edge cases by changing only the variable portion
- **Scalability:** Simplify prompt management as your application grows in complexity
- **Version control:** Easily track changes to your prompt structure over time by keeping tabs only on the core part of your prompt, separate from dynamic inputs

The [Claude Console](/) heavily uses prompt templates and variables in order to support features and tooling for all the above, such as with the:
- **[Prompt generator](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator):** Decides what variables your prompt needs and includes them in the template it outputs
- **[Prompt improver](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver):** Takes your existing template, including all variables, and maintains them in the improved template it outputs
- **[Evaluation tool](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool):** Allows you to easily test, scale, and track versions of your prompts by separating the variable and fixed portions of your prompt template

---

# Example prompt template

Let's consider a simple application that translates English text to Spanish. The translated text would be variable since you would expect this text to change between users or calls to Claude. This translated text could be dynamically retrieved from databases or the user's input.

Thus, for your translation app, you might use this simple prompt template:
```
Translate this text from English to Spanish: {{text}}
```

# Use our prompt improver to optimize your prompts

---

<Note>
Our prompt improver is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Note>

The prompt improver helps you quickly iterate and improve your prompts through automated analysis and enhancement. It excels at making prompts more robust for complex tasks that require high accuracy.

<Frame>
  ![Image](/docs/images/prompt_improver.png)
</Frame>

## Before you begin

You'll need:
- A [prompt template](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables) to improve
- Feedback on current issues with Claude's outputs (optional but recommended)
- Example inputs and ideal outputs (optional but recommended)

## How the prompt improver works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process

You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.

## What you get

The prompt improver generates templates with:
- Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude's reasoning process and typically improve its performance
- Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components
- Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output
- Strategic prefills that guide Claude's initial responses

<Note>
While examples appear separately in the Workbench UI, they're included at the start of the first user message in the actual API call. View the raw format by clicking "**\<\/\> Get Code**" or insert examples as raw text via the Examples box.
</Note>

## How to use the prompt improver

1. Submit your prompt template
2. Add any feedback about issues with Claude's current outputs (e.g., "summaries are too basic for expert audiences")
3. Include example inputs and ideal outputs
4. Review the improved prompt

## Generate test examples

Don't have examples yet? Use our [Test Case Generator](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool#creating-test-cases) to:
1. Generate sample inputs
2. Get Claude's responses
3. Edit the responses to match your ideal outputs
4. Add the polished examples to your prompt

## When to use the prompt improver

The prompt improver works best for:
- Complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning
- Situations where accuracy is more important than speed
- Problems where Claude's current outputs need significant improvement

<Note>
For latency or cost-sensitive applications, consider using simpler prompts. The prompt improver creates templates that produce longer, more thorough, but slower responses.
</Note>

## Example improvement

Here's how the prompt improver enhances a basic classification prompt:

<section title="Original prompt">

```
From the following list of Wikipedia article titles, identify which article this sentence came from.
Respond with just the article title and nothing else.

Article titles:
{{titles}}

Sentence to classify:
{{sentence}}
```

</section>

<section title="Improved prompt">

```
You are an intelligent text classification system specialized in matching sentences to Wikipedia article titles. Your task is to identify which Wikipedia article a given sentence most likely belongs to, based on a provided list of article titles.

First, review the following list of Wikipedia article titles:
<article_titles>
{{titles}}
</article_titles>

Now, consider this sentence that needs to be classified:
<sentence_to_classify>
{{sentence}}
</sentence_to_classify>

Your goal is to determine which article title from the provided list best matches the given sentence. Follow these steps:

1. List the key concepts from the sentence
2. Compare each key concept with the article titles
3. Rank the top 3 most relevant titles and explain why they are relevant
4. Select the most appropriate article title that best encompasses or relates to the sentence's content

Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags. Include the following:
- List of key concepts from the sentence
- Comparison of each key concept with the article titles
- Ranking of top 3 most relevant titles with explanations
- Your final choice and reasoning

After your analysis, provide your final answer: the single most appropriate Wikipedia article title from the list.

Output only the chosen article title, without any additional text or explanation.
```

</section>

Notice how the improved prompt:
- Adds clear step-by-step reasoning instructions
- Uses XML tags to organize content
- Provides explicit output formatting requirements
- Guides Claude through the analysis process

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Examples not appearing in output**: Check that examples are properly formatted with XML tags and appear at the start of the first user message
- **Chain of thought too verbose**: Add specific instructions about desired output length and level of detail
- **Reasoning steps don't match your needs**: Modify the steps section to match your specific use case

# Be clear, direct, and detailed

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working.
The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude's response will be.

<Tip>**The golden rule of clear prompting**<br/>Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they're confused, Claude will likely be too.</Tip>

## How to be clear, contextual, and specific

- **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
    - What the task results will be used for
    - What audience the output is meant for
    - What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
    - The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
- **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
- **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

### Examples

    <section title="Example: Anonymizing customer feedback">

    Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer's name.

    | Role | Unclear Prompt | Clear Prompt |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | User | Please remove all personally identifiable information from these customer feedback messages: \{\{FEEDBACK_DATA\}\} | Your task is to anonymize customer feedback for our quarterly review.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>1. Replace all customer names with "CUSTOMER_[ID]" (e.g., "Jane Doe" → "CUSTOMER_001").<br/>2. Replace email addresses with "EMAIL_[ID]@example.com".<br/>3. Redact phone numbers as "PHONE_[ID]".<br/>4. If a message mentions a specific product (e.g., "AcmeCloud"), leave it intact.<br/>5. If no PII is found, copy the message verbatim.<br/>6. Output only the processed messages, separated by "---".<br/><br/>Data to process: \{\{FEEDBACK_DATA\}\} |
    | Assistant (Claude's response) | Here are the anonymized customer feedback messages:<br/>1. I've been using your software for years, and it's been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br/>2. XXX, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process. My email is XXX if you want to send a survey.<br/>3. I'm John Smith, and I'm not happy. I've been on hold for 2 hours trying to reach someone at XXX. This is unacceptable! | CUSTOMER_001: I've been using your software for years, and it's been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br/>---<br/>CUSTOMER_002: CUSTOMER_SERVICE_001, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process.

This is unacceptable! |
    
</section>
    <section title="Example: Crafting a marketing email campaign">

    Notice that Claude makes up details to fill in the gaps where it lacks context with the vague prompt.

    | Role | Vague Prompt | Specific Prompt |

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs.
This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

<Tip>**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.</Tip>

## Why use examples?

- **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
- **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
- **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:
- **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
- **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

<Tip>Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.</Tip>
<section title="Example: Analyzing customer feedback">

    Notice that in the "no examples" version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.

    | Role | No Examples | With Examples |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | User | Analyze this customer feedback and categorize the issues. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low).<br/><br/>Here is the feedback: \{\{FEEDBACK\}\} | Our CS team is overwhelmed with unstructured feedback. Your task is to analyze feedback and categorize issues for our product and engineering teams. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low). Here is an example:<br/><br/>\<example><br/>Input: The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High\</example><br/><br/>Now, analyze this feedback: \{\{FEEDBACK\}\} |
    | Assistant (Claude's response) | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:<br/><br/>Issue: UI/UX<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer is frustrated with the new dashboard design, which they find cluttered and slow to load. They specifically call out the missing "export" button, which is likely a critical feature. This issue needs to be addressed as a high priority.<br/><br/>Issue: Integration<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Medium<br/>The customer is pleased with the existing Salesforce integration but would like to see support for Hubspot as well. This is a feature request that could be considered for a future product update.<br/><br/>Issue: Pricing<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer finds the pricing to be unreasonable, especially for the basic features. They are threatening to switch to a competitor, so this is a high-priority issue that needs to be reviewed.<br/><br/>Issue: Performance<br/>Sentiment Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer is experiencing critical issues with the mobile app, where large file uploads consistently result in crashes. This is a significant problem that impacts the customer's ability to use the product effectively and should be addressed as a high priority.<br/><br/>Issue: UI/UX<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Low<br/>The customer is overall satisfied with the product, specifically calling out the intuitive UI and excellent customer support. This is a positive piece of feedback that does not require any immediate action. | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:<br/><br/>1. The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>2. Love the Salesforce integration! But it'd be great if you could add Hubspot too.<br/>Category: Integration, Feature Request<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Medium<br/><br/>3. Your pricing is ridiculous! $99/mo for basic features? I'm switching to Competitor X.<br/>Category: Pricing<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>4. The mobile app keeps crashing when I try to upload large files (>50MB). This is critical for our field agents.<br/>Category: Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>5. Overall, I'm happy with the product. The UI is intuitive, and the customer support is top-notch. Keep it up!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Other (Customer Support)<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Low |

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?
- **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
- **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
- **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?
- Increased output length may impact latency.
- Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

<Tip>Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.</Tip>

***

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

<Tip>**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!</Tip>

- **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.
    - Lacks guidance on *how* to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)
    <section title="Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)">

        | Role | Content |
        | ---- | ------- |
        | User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.<br/><br/>Program information:<br/>\\{\{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}<br/>\</program><br/><br/>Donor information:<br/>\<donor>\{\{DONOR_DETAILS}}<br/>\</donor><br/><br/>Think step-by-step before you write the email. |
    
</section>
- **Guided prompt**: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.
    - Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the thinking.
    <section title="Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)">

        | Role | Content |
        | ---- | ------- |
        | User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.<br/><br/>Program information:<br/>\\{\{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}<br/>\</program><br/><br/>Donor information:<br/>\<donor>\{\{DONOR_DETAILS}}<br/>\</donor><br/><br/>Think before you write the email. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email using your analysis. |
    
</section>
- **Structured prompt**: Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.
     <section title="Example: Writing donor emails (structured guided CoT)">

        | Role | Content |
        | ---- | ------- |
        | User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.<br/><br/>Program information:<br/>\\{\{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}<br/>\</program><br/><br/>Donor information:<br/>\<donor>\{\{DONOR_DETAILS}}<br/>\</donor><br/><br/>Think before you write the email in \<thinking> tags. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email in \<email> tags, using your analysis. |

### Examples

  <section title="Example: Financial analysis without thinking">

    Without step-by-step thinking, Claude gives a recommendation that seems reasonable but lacks depth. It doesn't quantify the potential outcomes or consider historical market performance, which are crucial for making an informed decision.
    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? |
    | Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br/>2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br/>3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br/><br/>While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |
  
</section>
  <section title="Example: Financial analysis with thinking">

    With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.
    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step. |
    | Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<br/><br/>\<thinking><br/>1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:<br/>   - Goal: Down payment for a house<br/>   - Timeline: 5 years<br/>   - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br/><br/>2. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br/>   - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br/>   - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br/>   - Calculate potential 5-year return:<br/>     - Best case (12% annually): \$10,000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ \$17,623.42<br/>     - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = \$5,000<br/><br/>3. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br/>   - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br/>   - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br/>   - Calculate 5-year return:<br/>     - Guaranteed: \$10,000 * (1.06)^5 ≈ \$13,382.25<br/><br/>4. Consider risk tolerance:<br/>   - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br/>   - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br/>   - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br/><br/>5. Historical perspective:<br/>   - Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br/>   - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br/>     - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&P 500 up ~82%<br/>     - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&P 500 down ~2%<br/>   - Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term<br/><br/>6. Final analysis:<br/>   - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal<br/>   - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet ~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds<br/>\</thinking><br/><br/>\<answer><br/>I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have \$13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.<br/>\</answer> |

# Use XML tags to structure your prompts

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

<Tip>**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.</Tip>

## Why use XML tags?

- **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
- **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
- **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

<Note>There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.</Note>

***

## Tagging best practices

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2. **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

<Tip>**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.</Tip>

### Examples

  <section title="Example: Generating financial reports">

    Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn't match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.

  <section title="Example: Legal contract analysis">

    Without XML tags, Claude's analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on.

# Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.

The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

<Tip>**System prompt tips**: Use the `system` parameter to set Claude's role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.</Tip>

## Why use role prompting?

- **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude's performance.
- **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO's brevity or a copywriter's flair, role prompting adjusts Claude's communication style.
- **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task's specific requirements.

***

## How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](/docs/en/api/messages) to set Claude's role:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

<Tip>**Role prompting tip**: Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!</Tip>

***

## Examples

### Example 1: Legal contract analysis
Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:

<section title="Legal contract analysis without role prompting">

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:<br/>\<contract><br/>\{\{CONTRACT\}\}<br/>\</contract><br/><br/>Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. |
| Assistant | Here's a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:<br/><br/>1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br/>   - We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.<br/><br/>2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br/>   - Damages capped at \$500.<br/><br/>3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br/>   - We retain ownership of our modifications.<br/><br/>Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights. |

</section>

With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:

<section title="Legal contract analysis with role prompting">

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We're considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:<br/>\<contract><br/>\{\{CONTRACT\}\}<br/>\</contract><br/><br/>Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion. |
| Assistant | I've reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:<br/><br/>1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br/>   - Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use.<br/>   - Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor's negligence or product defects.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.<br/><br/>2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br/>   - Critical Issue: Damages capped at \$500, including direct damages.<br/>   - Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br/><br/>3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br/>   - Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br/>   - Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br/><br/>Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |

</section>

### Example 2: Financial analysis
Without a role, Claude's analysis lacks depth:

<section title="Financial analysis without role prompting">

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Analyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:<br/>\<data><br/>\{\{FINANCIALS\}\}<br/>\</data><br/><br/>Highlight key trends and recommend actions. |
| Assistant | Here's a summary of your Q2 financials:<br/><br/>1. Revenue: \$15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.<br/>2. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.<br/>3. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&D investments.<br/>4. Cash Flow: \$4.1M operating, \$28M in reserves.<br/><br/>Overall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course. |

</section>

With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:

<section title="Financial analysis with role prompting">

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We're in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:<br/>\<data><br/>\{\{FINANCIALS\}\}<br/>\</data><br/><br/>Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate. |
| Assistant | Board members, here's my analysis of our Q2 financials:<br/><br/>1. Revenue (\$15.2M, +22% YoY):<br/>   - Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.<br/>   - Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.<br/>   - Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.<br/><br/>2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):<br/>   - Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.<br/>   - Flag: R&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.<br/>   - Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.<br/><br/>3. Cash (\$4.1M OCF, \$28M reserves):<br/>   - Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.<br/>   - Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.<br/>   - Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.<br/><br/>Strategic Stance: We're threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&D by 30%.<br/><br/>In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions? |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps. 

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:
- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

  <section title="Example: Self-correcting research summary">

    #### Prompt 1
    | Role | Content |

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br/><br/>Findings:<br/>- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br/>- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br/>- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br/><br/>Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br/><br/>Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br/><br/>Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

    | Assistant<br/>\{\{STRATEGY_DOC}} | # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product<br/><br/>## Executive Summary<br/>The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br/><br/>## Detailed Analysis<br/><br/>### 1. Scalability: B+<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br/>- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br/>- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br/><br/>### 2. Security: B-<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br/>- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br/>- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br/>- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br/><br/>### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br/>- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br/>- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br/>- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br/><br/>## Recommendations<br/><br/>1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br/><br/>2. **Security Hardening**:<br/>   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br/>   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br/>   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br/><br/>3. **Cost Optimization**:<br/>   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br/>   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br/>   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br/><br/>4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br/>   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br/>   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br/>   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br/><br/>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

    | Assistant | 1. Clarity: A<br/>   + Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.<br/>   + Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.<br/>   + Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.<br/>   + Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.<br/><br/>2. Actionability: A-<br/>   + Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., "Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes").<br/>   + PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.<br/>   + Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.<br/>   + Consider: Add a "Next Steps" section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.<br/><br/>3. Enterprise Alignment: A+<br/>   + Directly addresses enterprise priorities:<br/>     - Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br/>     - Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.<br/>     - Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).<br/>   + PoC with "high-scale simulation" and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.<br/>   + Language resonates with enterprise concerns: "unacceptable risk," "enterprise-grade," "instill confidence."<br/><br/>Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a "Next Steps" section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |

# Long context prompting tips

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Claude's extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. This guide will help you leverage this power effectively.

## Essential tips for long context prompts

- **Put longform data at the top**: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.

    <Note>Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.</Note>

- **Structure document content and metadata with XML tags**: When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.

    <section title="Example multi-document structure">

    ```xml
    <documents>
      <document index="1">
        <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
        <document_content>
          {{ANNUAL_REPORT}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="2">
        <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
        <document_content>
          {{COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
    </documents>

    Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
    ```
    
</section>

- **Ground responses in quotes**: For long document tasks, ask Claude to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task. This helps Claude cut through the "noise" of the rest of the document's contents.

    <section title="Example quote extraction">

    ```xml
    You are an AI physician's assistant. Your task is to help doctors diagnose possible patient illnesses.

    <documents>
      <document index="1">
        <source>patient_symptoms.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT_SYMPTOMS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="2">
        <source>patient_records.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT_RECORDS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="3">
        <source>patient01_appt_history.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT01_APPOINTMENT_HISTORY}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
    </documents>

    Find quotes from the patient records and appointment history that are relevant to diagnosing the patient's reported symptoms. Place these in <quotes> tags. Then, based on these quotes, list all information that would help the doctor diagnose the patient's symptoms. Place your diagnostic information in <info> tags.
    ```

# Extended thinking tips

---

This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of Claude's extended thinking features. Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks. 

See [Extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking.

## Before diving in

This guide presumes that you have already decided to use extended thinking mode and have reviewed our [extended thinking implementation guide](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).

### Technical considerations for extended thinking

- Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens. We recommend that you start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based on your needs and task complexity.
- For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that you use [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
- Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in [any language Claude supports](/docs/en/build-with-claude/multilingual-support).
- If you need thinking below the minimum budget, we recommend using standard mode, with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML tags (like `<thinking>`). See [chain of thought prompting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).

## Prompting techniques for extended thinking

### Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions

Claude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model's creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.

For example, instead of:

<CodeGroup>
```text User
Think through this math problem step by step: 
1. First, identify the variables
2. Then, set up the equation
3. Next, solve for x
...
```
</CodeGroup>

Consider:

<CodeGroup>
```text User
Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
```
/>
</CodeGroup>

<TryInConsoleButton
  userPrompt={
    `Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.`
  }
  thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}
>
  Try in Console
</TryInConsoleButton>

That said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when needed. The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than previous versions. We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then read Claude's thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its thinking from there.

### Multishot prompting with extended thinking

[Multishot prompting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) works well with extended thinking. When you provide Claude examples of how to think through problems, it will follow similar reasoning patterns within its extended thinking blocks.

You can include few-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by using XML tags like `<thinking>` or `<scratchpad>` to indicate canonical patterns of extended thinking in those examples.  

Claude will generalize the pattern to the formal extended thinking process. However, it's possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
```text User
I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

<thinking>
To find 15% of 80:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
</thinking>

The answer is 12.

Now solve this one:
Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?
```
/>
</CodeGroup>

<TryInConsoleButton
  userPrompt={
    `I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

<thinking>
To find 15% of 80:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
</thinking>

The answer is 12.

Now solve this one:
Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?`
  }
  thinkingBudgetTokens={16000} 
>
  Try in Console
</TryInConsoleButton>

### Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking
Claude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is enabled. The model typically:
1. Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block
2. Executes those instructions in the response

To maximize instruction following:
- Be clear and specific about what you want
- For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude should work through methodically
- Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking

### Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior
You can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claude's logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.

To make the best use of this methodology, we recommend the following tips:
- We don't recommend passing Claude's extended thinking back in the user text block, as this doesn't improve performance and may actually degrade results.
- Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block is likely going to degrade results due to model confusion.

When extended thinking is turned off, standard `assistant` response text prefill is still allowed.

<Note>
Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text. If you want a clean response, instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the answer.
</Note>

### Making the best of long outputs and longform thinking

For dataset generation use cases, try prompts such as "Please create an extremely detailed table of..." for generating comprehensive datasets.

For use cases such as detailed content generation where you may want to generate longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses, try these tips:
- Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer outputs
- For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts down to the paragraph level. Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline and maintain the specified word counts

<Warning>
We do not recommend that you push Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens' sake. Rather, we encourage you to start with a small thinking budget and increase as needed to find the optimal settings for your use case.
</Warning>

Here are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:

  <section title="Complex STEM problems">

    Complex STEM problems require Claude to build mental models, apply specialized knowledge, and work through sequential logical steps—processes that benefit from longer reasoning time.

### Have Claude reflect on and check its work for improved consistency and error handling
You can use simple natural language prompting to improve consistency and reduce errors:
1. Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
2. Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result
3. For coding tasks, ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking

Example:

<CodeGroup>
```text User
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. 
Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:
- n=0
- n=1
- n=5
- n=10
And fix any issues you find.
```
